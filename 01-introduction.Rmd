# Let's Toss a Coin {#intro}

To illustrate the concepts behind object-oriented programming in R, we are going 
to consider a classic chance process (or chance experiment) of flipping a coin.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = '20%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/flip-coin.jpg")
```

In this chapter you will learn how to implement code in R that simulates tossing 
a coin one or more times.


## Coin object

Think about a standard coin with two sides: _heads_ and _tails_.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = '30%', fig.cap='two sides of a coin'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/coin-sides.png")
```

To toss a coin using R, we first need an object that plays the role of a coin. 
How do you create such a coin? Perhaps the simplest way to create a coin with 
two sides, `"heads"` and `"tails"`, is with a character vector via the _combine_ 
function `c()`:

```{r coin-vector}
# a (virtual) coin object
coin <- c("heads", "tails")
coin
```

You can also create a _numeric_ coin that shows `1` and `0` instead of
`"heads"` and `"tails"`:

```{r}
num_coin <- c(1, 0)
num_coin
```

Likewise, you can also create a _logical_ coin that shows `TRUE` and `FALSE` 
instead of `"heads"` and `"tails"`:

```{r}
log_coin <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
log_coin
```


## Tossing a coin

Once you have an R object that represents a _coin_, the next step involves 
learning how to simulate tossing the coin.

The important thing to keep in mind is that tossing a coin is a random 
experiment: you either get heads or tails. One way to simulate the action of 
tossing a coin in R is with the function `sample()` which lets you draw random 
samples, with or without replacement, of the elements in the input vector. 

Here's how to simulate a coin toss using `sample()` to take a random sample of 
size 1 of the elements in `coin`:

```{r}
# toss a coin
coin <- c('heads', 'tails')

sample(coin, size = 1)
```

You use the argument `size = 1` to specify that you want to take a sample of 
size 1 from the input vector `coin`.


### Random Samples

By default, `sample()` takes a sample of the specified `size` 
__without replacement__. If `size = 1`, it does not really matter whether the 
sample is done with or without replacement. 

To draw two elements __without__ replacement, use `sample()` like this:

```{r}
# draw 2 elements without replacement
sample(coin, size = 2)
```

This is equivalent to calling `sample()` with the argument `replace = FALSE`:

```{r}
sample(coin, size = 2, replace = FALSE)
```

What if you try to toss the coin three or four times?

```{r eval = FALSE}
# trying to toss coin 3 times (produces an error)
sample(coin, size = 3)
```

Notice that R produced an error message:

```
Error in sample.int(length(x), size, replace, prob): cannot take a 
sample larger than the population when 'replace = FALSE'
```

This is because the default behavior of `sample()` cannot draw more elements 
than the length of the input vector.

To be able to draw more elements, you need to sample __with replacement__, which 
is done by specifying the argument `replace = TRUE`, like this:

```{r}
# draw 4 elements with replacement
sample(coin, size = 4, replace = TRUE)
```



## The Random Seed

The way `sample()` works is by taking a random sample from the input vector. 
This means that every time you invoke `sample()` you will likely get a different 
output. For instance, when we run the following command twice, the output of 
the first call is different from the output in the second call, even though the
command is exactly the same in both cases:

```{r}
# five tosses
sample(coin, size = 5, replace = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# another five tosses
sample(coin, size = 5, replace = TRUE)
```


In order to make the examples replicable (so you can get the same output as mine), 
you need to specify what is called a __random seed__. This is done with the 
function `set.seed()`. By setting a _seed_, every time you use one of the random 
generator functions, like `sample()`, you will get the same values.

```{r}
# set random seed
set.seed(1257)

# toss a coin with replacement
sample(coin, size = 4, replace = TRUE)
```


## Sampling with different probabilities

Last but not least, `sample()` comes with the argument `prob` which allows you 
to provide specific probabilities for each element in the input vector.

By default, `prob = NULL`, which means that every element has the same probability 
of being drawn. In the example of tossing a coin, the command `sample(coin)` is 
equivalent to `sample(coin, prob = c(0.5, 0.5))`. In the latter case we 
explicitly specify a probability of 50% chance of heads, and 50% chance of tails:

```{r}
# tossing a fair coin
coin <- c("heads", "tails")

sample(coin)

# equivalent
sample(coin, prob = c(0.5, 0.5))
```

However, you can provide different probabilities for each of the elements in the 
input vector. For instance, to simulate a __loaded__ coin with chance of heads 
20%, and chance of tails 80%, set `prob = c(0.2, 0.8)` like so:

```{r}
# tossing a loaded coin (20% heads, 80% tails)
sample(coin, size = 5, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.2, 0.8))
```


### Simulating tossing a coin

Now that we have all the elements to toss a coin with R, let's simulate flipping 
a coin 100 times, and then use the function `table()` to count the resulting 
number of `"heads"` and `"tails"`:

```{r}
# number of flips
num_flips <- 100

# flips simulation
coin <- c('heads', 'tails')
flips <- sample(coin, size = num_flips, replace = TRUE)

# number of heads and tails
freqs <- table(flips)
freqs
```

In my case, I got `r freqs[1]` heads and `r freqs[2]` tails. Your results will 
probably be different than mine. Sometimes you will get more `"heads"`, sometimes 
you will get more `"tails"`, and sometimes you will get exactly 50 `"heads"` 
and 50 `"tails"`.

Let's run another series of 100 flips, and find the frequency of `"heads"` and 
`"tails"` with the help of the `table()` function:

```{r flips100}
# one more 100 flips
flips <- sample(coin, size = num_flips, replace = TRUE)
freqs <- table(flips)
freqs
```


To make things more interesting, let's consider how the frequency of `heads` 
evolves over a series of _n_ tosses (in this case _n_ = `num_flips`).

```{r heads_freq}
heads_freq <- cumsum(flips == 'heads') / 1:num_flips
```

With the vector `heads_freq`, we can graph the (cumulative) relative frequencies 
with a line-plot:

```{r fig.cap="Cumulative relative frequencies of heads"}
plot(heads_freq,      # vector
     type = 'l',      # line type
     lwd = 2,         # width of line
     col = 'tomato',  # color of line
     las = 1,         # orientation of tick-mark labels
     ylim = c(0, 1),  # range of y-axis
     xlab = "number of tosses",    # x-axis label
     ylab = "relative frequency")  # y-axis label
abline(h = 0.5, col = 'gray50')
```
