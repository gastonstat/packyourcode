# Tossing Function {#function}

## Introduction

In the previous chapter we wrote code to simulate tossing a coin multiple times. 
First we created a virtual `coin` as a two-element vector. Secondly, we discussed 
how to use the function `sample()` to obtain a sample of a given size, with and
without replacement. And finally we put everything together: a `coin` object 
passed to `sample()`, to simulate tossing a coin.

```{r}
# tossing a coin 5 times
coin <- c("heads", "tails")
sample(coin, size = 5, replace = TRUE)
```

Our previous code works and we could get various sets of tosses of different 
sizes: 10 tosses, or 50, or 1000, or more:

```{r}
# various sets of tosses
flips1 <- sample(coin, size = 1, replace = TRUE)
flips10 <- sample(coin, size = 10, replace = TRUE)
flips50 <- sample(coin, size = 50, replace = TRUE)
flips1000 <- sample(coin, size = 1000, replace = TRUE)
```

As you can tell, even a single toss requires using the command 
`sample(coin, size = 1, replace = TRUE)` which is a bit long and requires some 
typing. Also, notice that we are repeating the call of `sample()` several times. 
This is the classic indication that we should instead write a function to 
encapsulate our code and reduce repetition.


## A `toss()` function

Let's make things a little bit more complex but also more interesting. Instead 
of calling `sample()` every time we want to toss a coin, we can write a 
dedicated `toss()` function, something like this:

```{r toss-function-ver1}
# toss function (version 1)
toss <- function(x, times = 1) {
  sample(x, size = times, replace = TRUE)
}
```

Recall that, to define a new function in R, you use the function `function()`. 
You need to specify a name for the function, and then assign `function()` to the 
chosen name. You also need to define optional arguments, which are basically the
inputs of the function. And of course, you must write the code (i.e. the body) 
so the function does something when you use it. In summary:

- Generally, you give a name to a function.

- A function takes one or more inputs (or none), known as _arguments_.

- The expressions forming the operations comprise the __body__ of the function.

- Usually, you wrap the body of the functions with curly braces.

- A function returns a single value.

Once defined, you can use `toss()` like any other function in R:

```{r}
# basic call
toss(coin)

# toss 5 times
toss(coin, 5)
```

Because we can make use of the `prob` argument inside `sample()`, we can make 
the `toss()` function more versatile by adding an argument that let us specify 
different probabilities for each side of a coin:

```{r toss-function-ver2}
# toss function (version 2)
toss <- function(x, times = 1, prob = NULL) {
  sample(x, size = times, replace = TRUE, prob = prob)
}

# fair coin (default)
toss(coin, times = 5)

# laoded coin
toss(coin, times = 5, prob = c(0.8, 0.2))
```


## Documenting Functions

You should strive to always include _documentation_ for your functions. In fact, 
writing documentation for your functions should become second nature. What does 
this mean? Documenting a function involves adding descriptions for the purpose 
of the function, the inputs it accepts, and the output it produces. 

- Description: what the function does

- Input(s): what are the inputs or arguments

- Output: what is the output or returned value

You can find some inspiration in the `help()` documentation when your search 
for a given function: e.g. `help(mean)`

A typical way to write documentation for a function is by adding comments for 
things like the description, input(s), output(s), like in the code below:

```{r toss-function-ver3, eval = FALSE}
# Description: tosses a coin
# Inputs
#   x: coin object (a vector)
#   times: how many times
#   prob: probability values for each side
# Output
#   vector of tosses
toss <- function(x, times = 1, prob = NULL) {
  sample(x, size = times, replace = TRUE, prob = prob)
}
```


## Roxygen Comments

I'm going to take advantage of our `toss()` function to introduce __Roxygen__ 
comments. As you know, the hash symbol `#` has a special meaning in R: you use 
it to indicate comments in your code. Interestingly, there is a special kind of 
comment called an "R oxygen" comment, or simply _roxygen_ comment. As any R 
comment, Roxygen comments are also indicated with a hash; unlike standard 
comments, Roxygen comments have an appended apostrophe: `#'`.

You use Roxygen comments to write documentation for your functions. Let's see 
an example and then I will explain what's going on with the roxygen comments:

```{r toss-function2}
#' @title Coin toss function 
#' @description Simulates tossing a coin a given number of times
#' @param x coin object (a vector)
#' @param times number of tosses
#' @param prob vector of probabilities for each side of the coin
#' @return vector of tosses
toss <- function(x, times = 1, prob = NULL) {
  sample(x, size = times, replace = TRUE, prob = prob)
}
```

If you type the above code in an R script, or inside a coce chunk of a dynamic 
document (e.g. `Rmd` file), you should be able to see how RStudio highlights 
Roxygen keywords such as `@title` and `@description`. Here's a screenshot of 
what the code looks like in my computer:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = '75%', fig.cap="Highlighted keywords of roxygen comments"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/toss-function.png")
```

Notice that each keyword of the form `@word` appears in blue (yours may be in a 
different color depending on the highlighting scheme that you use). Also notice 
the different color of each parameter (`@param`) name like `x`, `times`, and `prob`. 

If you look at the code of other R packages, it is possible to find Roxygen 
documentation in which there is no `@title` and `@description`, something like 
this:

```{r toss-function4}
#' Coin toss function
#'
#' Simulates tossing a coin a given number of times
#'
#' @param x coin object (a vector)
#' @param times number of tosses
#' @param prob vector of probabilities for each side of the coin
#' @return vector of tosses
toss <- function(x, times = 1, prob = NULL) {
  sample(x, size = times, replace = TRUE, prob = prob)
}
```

When you see Roxygen comments like the above ones, the text in the first line 
is treated as the `@title` of the function, and then the text after the empty 
line is considered to be the `@description`. Notice how both lines of text have 
an empty line below them!

The `@return` keyword is optional. But I strongly recommend including `@return` 
because it is part of a function's documentation: title, description, inputs, 
and output.


### About Roxygen Comments

At this point you may be asking yourself: "Do I really need to document my 
functions with roxygen comments?" The short answer is No; you don't. So why 
bother? Because royxgen comments are very convenient when you take a set of 
functions that will be used to build an R package. In later chapters we will 
describe more details about roxygen comments and roxygen keywords. The way we 
are going to build a package involves running some functions that will take the 
content of the roxygen comments into account and use them to generate what is 
called `Rd` (R-dcoumentation) files. These are actually the files behind all 
the help (or manual) documentation pages of any function.
