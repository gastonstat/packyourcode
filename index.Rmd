## Preface {-}

The ultimate goal of this book is to teach you how to create a relatively simple 
R package based on the so-called S3 classes. 

The chapters of the book are organized in four major parts:

- The first part involves describing a motivating example about using R to write 
code for tossing a coin. We begin tackling this problem from a 
_classic programming_ style (as opposed to a more object-oriented style).

- The second part is dedicated to implement code in a more object-oriented 
programming (OOP) fashion by using S3-class objects. Keep in mind that the S3 
system is a very informal OOP approach. However, it is the most common system 
among the universe of R packages.

- The third part discusses the anatomy of an R package, and how the various 
files are organized in a formal filestructure. The purpose of this part is to
review the main type of directories, subdirectories, and files ina package, as 
well as some usual components that are worth including in a package. 

- The fourth part of the book has to do with the actual process of building 
a package. We describe the differrent possible states, showing an opinionated 
flow for building a package.



### About this book {-}

The main reason for me to write this book was the lack of a teaching resource 
that I could use with the students in my computational statistics courses at the 
University of California Berkeley (e.g. Stat 133, 159, 243, 259). Not only I 
saw the need, but also the opportunity, to refine a couple of tutorial documents 
that I had written for those courses. I hope that this book can help not only 
students in my courses but also many other useRs that are interested in creating 
R packages.

This book assumes a couple of things about you: familiarity with R in general, 
and more specifically with RStudio. You should have used `.R` (R script) and 
`.Rmd` (R markdwon) files before. You don't need to be an expert useR but you 
do need to feel comfortable working with various data structures: vectors, 
factors, arrays, matrices, lists, data frames, etc. Also, I assume that you have 
some basic programming experience: for example, you know how to create simple 
functions, you know how to use conditional structures like `if-then-else`, as 
well as loop structures such as `for()` loops or `while()` loops. And that you 
also have some experience writing tests of functions (ideally using the package 
`"testthat"`).



### Other Resources {-}

This is NOT a comprehensive text that covers every single aspect about creating 
R packages. Instead, I've written this book more in the spirit of an extended 
tutorial or guide document with a relatively simple working example.

If you are interested in the nitty gritty aspects about R packages, then you 
should read Hadley Wickham's excellent book on 
__[R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/package.html)__. In fact, in various 
chapters of _Pack YouR Code_, I will be constantly referring to the book 
_R Packages_ in the form of links like this: `r-pkgs: topic`; for example: 
[r-pkgs: Introduction](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/intro.html).

I also recommend reading Friedrich Leisch's manuscript 
__[Creating R Packages: A Tutorial](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Leisch-CreatingPackages.pdf)__. 
Personally, this tutorial helped me a lot to successfully complete creating my 
first R package in the spring of 2009, after several (enormously frustrating) 
failed attempts during 2007 and 2008. It's impressive to have witnessed how the 
package-creation process has been made more smooth since those years.

Another classic book with material about R packages is 
__Software for Data Analysis__ by John Chamber, the "master mind" behind the S 
language, on which the R language is based on.

If _R Packages_ is not enough for you, and you are still curious about more 
obscure and esoteric details, then you need to check the technical R manual 
__[Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html)__ 
(by the R Core Team). I should warn you: this is NOT a beginner friendly document.
