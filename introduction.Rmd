# Let's toss a coin {#intro}

To illustrate the concepts behind object-oriented programming in R, we are going to consider a classic chance process (or chance experiment) of flipping a coin.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("images/flip-coin.jpg")
```

In this chapter you will learn how to implement code in R that simulates tossing a coin one or more times.


## Coin object

Think about a standard coin with two sides: _heads_ and _tails_.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL, fig.cap='two sides of a coin'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/coin-sides.png")
```

To toss a coin using R, we first need an object that plays the role of a coin. How do you create such a coin? Perhaps the simplest way to create a coin with two sides, `"heads"` and `"tails"`, is with a character vector via the _combine_ function `c()`:

```{r coin-vector}
# a (virtual) coin object
coin <- c("heads", "tails")
coin
```

You can also create a _numeric_ coin that shows `1` and `0` instead of
`"heads"` and `"tails"`:

```{r}
num_coin <- c(1, 0)
num_coin
```

Likewise, you can also create a _logical_ coin that shows `TRUE` and `FALSE` 
instead of `"heads"` and `"tails"`:

```{r}
log_coin <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
log_coin
```


## Tossing a coin

Once you have an object that represents the _coin_, the next step involves learning how to simulate tossing the coin.

Tossing a coin is a random experiment: you either get heads or tails. One way to simulate the action of tossing a coin in R is with the function `sample()` which lets you draw random samples, with or without replacement, of the elements of an input vector. 

Here's how to simulate a coin toss using `sample()` to take a random sample of size 1 of the elements in `coin`:

```{r}
# toss a coin
coin <- c('heads', 'tails')

sample(coin, size = 1)
```

You use the argument `size = 1` to specify that you want to take a sample of size 1 from the input vector `coin`.


### Random Samples

By default, `sample()` takes a sample of the specified `size` __without replacement__. If `size = 1`, it does not really matter whether the sample is done with or without replacement. 

To draw two elements WITHOUT replacement, use `sample()` like this:

```{r}
# draw 2 elements without replacement
sample(coin, size = 2)
```

What if you try to toss the coin three or four times?

```{r}
# trying to toss coin 3 times
sample(coin, size = 3)
```

Notice that R produced an error message. This is because the default behavior of `sample()` cannot draw more elements than the length of the input vector.

To be able to draw more elements, you need to sample __with replacement__, which is done by specifying the argument `replace = TRUE`, like this:

```{r}
# draw 4 elements with replacement
sample(coin, size = 4, replace = TRUE)
```


## The Random Seed

The way `sample()` works is by taking a random sample from the input vector. This means that every time you invoke `sample()` you will likely get a different output.

```{r}
# five tosses
sample(coin, size = 5, replace = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# another five tosses
sample(coin, size = 5, replace = TRUE)
```


In order to make the examples replicable (so you can get the same output as mine), you need to specify what is called a __random seed__. This is done with the function `set.seed()`. By setting a _seed_, every time you use one of the random generator functions, like `sample()`, you will get the same values.

```{r}
# set random seed
set.seed(1257)

# toss a coin with replacement
sample(coin, size = 4, replace = TRUE)
```


## Sampling with different probabilities

Last but not least, `sample()` comes with the argument `prob` which allows you to provide specific probabilities for each element in the input vector.

By default, `prob = NULL`, which means that every element has the same probability of being drawn. In the example of tossing a coin, the command `sample(coin)` is equivalent to `sample(coin, prob = c(0.5, 0.5))`. In the latter case we explicitly specify a probability of 50% chance of heads, and 50% chance of tails:

```{r}
# tossing a fair coin
coin <- c("heads", "tails")

sample(coin)

# equivalent
sample(coin, prob = c(0.5, 0.5))
```

However, you can provide different probabilities for each of the elements in the input vector. For instance, to simulate a __loaded__ coin with chance of heads 20%, and chance of tails 80%, set `prob = c(0.2, 0.8)` like so:

```{r}
# tossing a loaded coin (20% heads, 80% tails)
sample(coin, size = 5, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.2, 0.8))
```


### Simulating tossing a coin

Now that we have all the elements to toss a coin with R, let's simulate flipping a coin 100 times, and then use the function `table()` to count the resulting number of `"heads"` and `"tails"`:

```{r}
# number of flips
num_flips <- 100

# flips simulation
coin <- c('heads', 'tails')
flips <- sample(coin, size = num_flips, replace = TRUE)

# number of heads and tails
freqs <- table(flips)
freqs
```

In my case, I got `r freqs[1]` heads and `r freqs[2]` tails. Your results will probably be different than mine. Sometimes you will get more `"heads"`, sometimes you will get more `"tails"`, and sometimes you will get exactly 50 `"heads"` and 50 `"tails"`.

Let's run another series of 100 flips, and find the frequency of `"heads"` and `"tails"` with the help of the `table()` function:

```{r flips100}
# one more 100 flips
flips <- sample(coin, size = num_flips, replace = TRUE)
freqs <- table(flips)
freqs
```


To make things more interesting, let's consider how the frequency of `heads` evolves over a series of _n_ tosses (in this case _n_ = `num_flips`).

```{r heads_freq}
heads_freq <- cumsum(flips == 'heads') / 1:num_flips
```

With the vector `heads_freq`, we can graph the (cumulative) relative frequencies with a line-plot:

```{r head_freqs_plot}
plot(heads_freq,      # vector
     type = 'l',      # line type
     lwd = 2,         # width of line
     col = 'tomato',  # color of line
     las = 1,         # orientation of tick-mark labels
     ylim = c(0, 1),  # range of y-axis
     ylab = "relative frequency")  # y-axis label
abline(h = 0.5, col = 'gray50')
```
