# Methods (part 2) {#methods2}

## Introduction

In this chapter you will learn how to create common S3 class methods such as `print()`, `summary()`, and `plot()`.


## Print Method

Until now we have a `toss()` function that produces objects of the homonym class `"toss"`. Right now this type of output is basically a list. For instance, consider a Mexican _peso_ with two sides: `aguila` and `sol`. And let's use `toss()` to flip a peso 15 times. 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL, fig.cap='An old Mexican peso (www.coinfactswiki.com)'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/peso.jpg")
```

By the way, flips are commonly referred to as _volados_ in Mexico:

```{r}
set.seed(789)
peso <- coin(c('aguila', 'sol'))
volados <- toss(peso, 15)
volados
```

Every time you type in the name of an object `"toss"`, like `volados` in the previous example, the output is displayed like any other list. R displays the values of `$coin` and its attributes (`attr`), the `$tosses`, the `$total`, the number of `$heads` and `$tails`, and finally the class attribute. 

Instead of displaying all the elements that are in the output list returned by `toss()`, it would be more convenient to display information in a more compact way, for instance some sort of text containing the following bullets:

- object "toss"
- coin: "aguila", "sol" 
- total tosses: 15 
- num of aguila: 11 
- num of sol: 4

Typically, most classes in R have a dedicated printing method. Depending on the type of object, the default printed information may consist of a couple of lines, or sometimes a very verbose output. To create such
a method we use the generic function `print()`. To be more precise, we declare a new print method for objects of class `"toss"` like so:

```{r print-toss}
# print method for object of class "toss"
print.toss <- function(x, ...) {
  cat('object "toss"\n')
  cat(sprintf('sides: "%s", "%s"', x$coin$sides[1], x$coin$sides[2]), "\n")
  cat(sprintf('prob: "%s", "%s"', x$coin$prob[1], x$coin$prob[2]), "\n")
  cat("total tosses:", x$total, "\n")
  cat(sprintf("num of %s:", x$coin$sides[1]), x$heads, "\n")
  cat(sprintf("num of %s:", x$coin$sides[2]), x$tails, "\n")
  invisible(x)
}
```

By convention, `print` methods return the value of their principal argument invisibly. The `invisible` function turns off automatic printing, thus preventing an infinite recursion when printing is done implicitly at the session level.

After a `print` method has been defined for an object `"toss"`, everytime you type an object of such class, R will search for the corresponding method and display the output accordingly:

```{r}
# testing print method
set.seed(789)
volados <- toss(peso, 15)
volados
```

Here's another example with the `quarter1` coin used in previous chapters:

```{r}
set.seed(555)
quarter1 <- coin(c("washington", "bald-eagle")) 
quarter_flips <- toss(quarter1, 50)
quarter_flips
```


## Summary Method

For most purposes the standard `print` method will be sufficient output. However, sometimes a more extensive display is required. This can be done with a `summary` function. To define this type of method we use the function `summary()`.

The way you declare a `summary` method is similar to the way you declare a `print` method. You need to specify `summary.toss`, indicating that there will be a new summary method for objects of class `"toss"`. The `summary` will return an object of class `"summary.toss"`, which is typically a list (although you can return any other type of data object).

Here's the `summary.toss()` function:

```{r summary-toss}
summary.toss <- function(x, ...) {
  proportions <- c(
    sum(x$tosses == x$coin$sides[1]) / x$total,
    sum(x$tosses == x$coin$sides[2]) / x$total
  )
  freqs <- data.frame(
    side = x$coin$sides,
    count = c(x$heads, x$tails),
    prop = proportions)
  obj <- list(freqs = freqs)
  class(obj) <- "summary.toss"
  obj
}
```

Let's test it:

```{r}
summary(quarter_flips)
```


When implementing `summary` methods for specific classes, there's actually one more method that you typically have to create: a sibling `print.summary` method. The reason why you need these pair of methods is because an object `"summary.toss"`---returned by `summary()`---will very likely need its own `print` method, thus requiring a `print.summary.toss()` function. 

```{r print-summary}
print.summary.toss <- function(x, ...) {
  cat('summary "toss"\n\n')
  print(x$freqs)
  invisible(x)
}
```

Let's test it:

```{r}
summary(quarter_flips)
```

You can actually store the output of `summary()` and inspect its contents:

```{r}
quarter_sum <- summary(quarter_flips)
names(quarter_sum)

# inspect it
quarter_sum$freqs
```



## Plot Method

We can also define a `plot` method for objects of class `"toss"`:

What we want to plot of an object `"toss"` is the series of realtive frequencies (of either `"heads"` ot `"tails"`). This means we need to create a couple of auxiliary functions:

```{r}
head_freqs <- function(x) {
  cumsum(x$tosses == x$coin$sides[1]) / 1:x$total
}


tail_freqs <- function(x) {
  cumsum(x$tosses == x$coin$sides[2]) / 1:x$total
}


frequencies <- function(x, side = 1) {
  if (side == 1) {
    return(head_freqs(x))
  } else {
    return(tail_freqs(x))
  }
}
```

Here's one way to define a `plot()` method for `"toss"` objects:

```{r plot-toss}
plot.toss <- function(x, side = 1, ...) {
  freqs <- frequencies(x, side = side)
  plot(1:x$total, freqs, type = "n", ylim = c(0, 1), las = 1,
       xlab = "number of tosses", bty = "n",
       ylab = sprintf("relative frequency of %s", x$coin$sides[side]))
  abline(h = 0.5, col = "gray70", lwd = 1.5)
  lines(1:x$total, freqs, col = "tomato", lwd = 2)
  title(sprintf("Relative Frequencies in a series of %s coin tosses", x$total))
}
```

Let's test our `plot` method:

```{r}
plot(quarter_flips)
```
