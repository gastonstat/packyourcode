["index.html", "Pack YouR Code Welcome", " Pack YouR Code Gaston Sanchez Welcome The ultimate goal of this book is to teach you how to create a relatively simple R package based on the so-called S3 classes. The chapters of the book are organized in three major parts: The first part involves describing a motivating example about using R to write code for tossing a coin. We begin tackling this problem from a classic programming style (as opposed to a more object-oriented style). The second part is dedicated to implement code in a more object-oriented programming (OOP) fashion by using S3-class objects. Keep in mind that the S3 system is a very informal OOP approach. However, it is the most common system among the universe of R packages. The third part of the book has to do with the actual process of organizing the R code into a formal package. We discuss the anatomy of a package, its differrent possible states, some usual components that are worth including in a package, and the flow for building a package. About this book The main reason to write this book was the lack of a teaching resource that I could use with the students in my computational statistics courses at the University of California Berkeley (e.g. Stat 133, 159, 243, 259). Not only I saw the need, but also the opportunity, to refine a couple of tutorial documents that I had written for those courses. I hope that this book can help not only students in my courses but also many other useRs that are interested in creating R packages. This book assumes a couple of things about you: familiarity with R in general, and more specifically with RStudio. You should have used .R (R script) and .Rmd (R markdwon) files before. You don’t need to be an expert useR but you do need to feel comfortable working with various data structures: vectors, factors, arrays, matrices, lists, data frames, etc. Also, I assume that you have some basic programming experience: for example, you know how to create simple functions, you know how to use conditional structures like if-then-else, as well as loop structures such as for() loops or while() loops. And that you also have some experience writing tests of functions (ideally using the package &quot;testthat&quot;). Other Resources This is NOT a comprehensive text that covers every single aspect about creating R packages. Instead, I’ve written this book more in the spirit of an extended tutorial or guide document with a relatively simple working example. If you are interested in the nitty gritty aspects about R packages, then you should read Hadley Wickham’s excellent book on R Packages. In fact, in various chapters of Pack YouR Code, I will be constantly referring to the book R Packages in the form of links like this: r-pkgs: topic; for example: r-pkgs: Introduction. I also recommend reading Friedrich Leisch’s manuscript Creating R Packages: A Tutorial. Personally, this tutorial helped me a lot to successfully complete creating my first R package in the spring of 2009, after several (enormously frustrating) failed attempts during 2007 and 2008. It’s impressive to have witnessed how the package-creation process has been made more smooth since those years. Another classic book with material about R packages is Software for Data Analysis by John Chamber, the “master mind” behind the S language, on which the R language is based on. If R Packages is not enough for you, and you are still curious about more obscure and esoteric details, then you need to check the technical R manual Writing R Extensions (by the R Core Team). I should warn you: this is NOT a beginner friendly document. This work, by Gaston Sanchez, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. "],
["intro.html", "1 Let’s toss a coin 1.1 Coin object 1.2 Tossing a coin 1.3 The Random Seed 1.4 Sampling with different probabilities", " 1 Let’s toss a coin To illustrate the concepts behind object-oriented programming in R, we are going to consider a classic chance process (or chance experiment) of flipping a coin. In this chapter you will learn how to implement code in R that simulates tossing a coin one or more times. 1.1 Coin object Think about a standard coin with two sides: heads and tails. Figure 1.1: two sides of a coin To toss a coin using R, we first need an object that plays the role of a coin. How do you create such a coin? Perhaps the simplest way to create a coin with two sides, &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;tails&quot;, is with a character vector via the combine function c(): # a (virtual) coin object coin &lt;- c(&quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;) coin #&gt; [1] &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; You can also create a numeric coin that shows 1 and 0 instead of &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;tails&quot;: num_coin &lt;- c(0, 1) num_coin #&gt; [1] 0 1 Likewise, you can also create a logical coin that shows TRUE and FALSE instead of &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;tails&quot;: log_coin &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE) log_coin #&gt; [1] TRUE FALSE 1.2 Tossing a coin Once you have an object that represents the coin, the next step involves learning how to simulate tossing the coin. Tossing a coin is a random experiment: you either get heads or tails. One way to simulate the action of tossing a coin in R is with the function sample() which lets you draw random samples, with or without replacement, of the elements of an input vector. Here’s how to simulate a coin toss using sample() to take a random sample of size 1 of the elements in coin: # toss a coin coin &lt;- c(&#39;heads&#39;, &#39;tails&#39;) sample(coin, size = 1) #&gt; [1] &quot;heads&quot; You use the argument size = 1 to specify that you want to take a sample of size 1 from the input vector coin. 1.2.1 Random Samples By default, sample() takes a sample of the specified size without replacement. If size = 1, it does not really matter whether the sample is done with or without replacement. To draw two elements WITHOUT replacement, use sample() like this: # draw 2 elements without replacement sample(coin, size = 2) #&gt; [1] &quot;tails&quot; &quot;heads&quot; What if you try to toss the coin three or four times? # trying to toss coin 3 times sample(coin, size = 3) #&gt; Error in sample.int(length(x), size, replace, prob): cannot take a sample larger than the population when &#39;replace = FALSE&#39; Notice that R produced an error message. This is because the default behavior of sample() cannot draw more elements that the length of the input vector. To be able to draw more elements, you need to sample with replacement, which is done by specifying the argument replace = TRUE, like this: # draw 4 elements with replacement sample(coin, size = 4, replace = TRUE) #&gt; [1] &quot;tails&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;heads&quot; 1.3 The Random Seed The way sample() works is by taking a random sample from the input vector. This means that every time you invoke sample() you will likely get a different output. # five tosses sample(coin, size = 5, replace = TRUE) #&gt; [1] &quot;tails&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;tails&quot; # another five tosses sample(coin, size = 5, replace = TRUE) #&gt; [1] &quot;tails&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; In order to make the examples replicable (so you can get the same output as mine), you need to specify what is called a random seed. This is done with the function set.seed(). By setting a seed, every time you use one of the random generator functions, like sample(), you will get the same values. # set random seed set.seed(1257) # toss a coin with replacement sample(coin, size = 4, replace = TRUE) #&gt; [1] &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; 1.4 Sampling with different probabilities Last but not least, sample() comes with the argument prob which allows you to provide specific probabilities for each element in the input vector. By default, prob = NULL, which means that every element has the same probability of being drawn. In the example of tossing a coin, the command sample(coin) is equivalent to sample(coin, prob = c(0.5, 0.5)). In the latter case we explicitly specify a probability of 50% chance of heads, and 50% chance of tails: # tossing a fair coin coin &lt;- c(&quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;) sample(coin) #&gt; [1] &quot;tails&quot; &quot;heads&quot; # equivalent sample(coin, prob = c(0.5, 0.5)) #&gt; [1] &quot;tails&quot; &quot;heads&quot; However, you can provide different probabilities for each of the elements in the input vector. For instance, to simulate a loaded coin with chance of heads 20%, and chance of tails 80%, set prob = c(0.2, 0.8) like so: # tossing a loaded coin (20% heads, 80% tails) sample(coin, size = 5, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.2, 0.8)) #&gt; [1] &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;tails&quot; 1.4.1 Simulating tossing a coin Now that we have all the elements to toss a coin with R, let’s simulate flipping a coin 100 times, and then use the function table() to count the resulting number of &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;tails&quot;: # number of flips num_flips &lt;- 100 # flips simulation coin &lt;- c(&#39;heads&#39;, &#39;tails&#39;) flips &lt;- sample(coin, size = num_flips, replace = TRUE) # number of heads and tails freqs &lt;- table(flips) freqs #&gt; flips #&gt; heads tails #&gt; 56 44 In my case, I got 56 heads and 44 tails. Your results will probably be different than mine. Sometimes you will get more &quot;heads&quot;, sometimes you will get more &quot;tails&quot;, and sometimes you will get exactly 50 &quot;heads&quot; and 50 &quot;tails&quot;. Run another series of 100 flips, and find the frequency of &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;tails&quot;: # one more 100 flips flips &lt;- sample(coin, size = num_flips, replace = TRUE) freqs &lt;- table(flips) freqs #&gt; flips #&gt; heads tails #&gt; 47 53 To make things more interesting, let’s consider how the frequency of heads evolves over a series of n tosses. heads_freq &lt;- cumsum(flips == &#39;heads&#39;) / 1:num_flips With the vector heads_freq, we can graph the relative frequencies with a line-plot: plot(heads_freq, # vector type = &#39;l&#39;, # line type lwd = 2, # width of line col = &#39;tomato&#39;, # color of line las = 1, # tick-marks labels orientation ylim = c(0, 1)) # range of y-axis abline(h = 0.5, col = &#39;gray50&#39;) "],
["function.html", "2 Tossing Function 2.1 Introduction 2.2 A toss() function 2.3 Documenting Functions 2.4 Roxygen Comments", " 2 Tossing Function 2.1 Introduction In the previous chapter we wrote code to simulate tossing a coin multiple times. First we created a virtual coin as a two-element vector. Secondly, we discussed the function sample() to obtain a sample, with replacement, of a given size. And finally we put everything together: a coin object passed to sample(), to simulate tossing a coin. # tossing a coin 5 times coin &lt;- c(&quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;) sample(coin, size = 5, replace = TRUE) #&gt; [1] &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;heads&quot; Our previous code works and we could get various sets of tosses of different sizes: 10 tosses, or 50, or 1000, or more: # various sets of tosses flips1 &lt;- sample(coin, size = 1, replace = TRUE) flips10 &lt;- sample(coin, size = 10, replace = TRUE) flips50 &lt;- sample(coin, size = 50, replace = TRUE) flips1000 &lt;- sample(coin, size = 1000, replace = TRUE) As you can tell, even a single toss requires using the command sample(coin, size = 1, replace = TRUE) which is a bit long and requires some typing. Also, notice that we are repeating the call of sample() several times. This is the classic indication that we should instead write a function to encapsulate our code and reduce repetition. 2.2 A toss() function Let’s make things a little bit more complex but also more interesting. Instead of calling sample() every time we want to toss a coin, we can write a toss() function, something like this: # toss function (version 1) toss &lt;- function(x, times = 1) { sample(x, size = times, replace = TRUE) } Recall that, to define a new function in R, you use the function function(). You need to specify a name for the function, and then assign function() to the chosen name. You also need to define optional arguments (i.e. inputs). And of course, you must write the code (i.e. the body) so the function does something when you use it. In summary: Generally, you give a name to a function. A function takes one or more inputs (or none), known as arguments. The expressions forming the operations comprise the body of the function. Usually, you wrap the body of the functions with curly braces. A function returns a single value. Once defined, you can use a function like any other function in R: # basic call toss(coin) #&gt; [1] &quot;heads&quot; # toss 5 times toss(coin, 5) #&gt; [1] &quot;tails&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; Because we can make use of the prob argument inside sample(), we can make the toss() function more versatile by adding an argument that let us specify different probabilities for each side of a coin: # toss function (version 1) toss &lt;- function(x, times = 1, prob = NULL) { sample(x, size = times, replace = TRUE, prob = prob) } # fair coin (default) toss(coin, times = 5) #&gt; [1] &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; # laoded coin toss(coin, times = 5, prob = c(0.8, 0.2)) #&gt; [1] &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;heads&quot; 2.3 Documenting Functions You should strive to always include documentation for your functions. In fact, writing documentation for your functions should become second nature. What does this mean? Documenting a function involves adding descriptions for the purpose of the function, the inputs it accepts, and the output it produces. Description: what the function does Input(s): what are the inputs or arguments Output: what is the output (returned value) You can find some inspiration in the help() documentation when your search for a given function: e.g. help(mean) A typical way to write documentation for a function is by adding comments for things like the description, input(s), output(s), like in the code below: # Description: tosses a coin # Inputs # x: coin object (a vector) # times: how many times # prob: probability values for each side # Output # vector of tosses toss &lt;- function(x, times = 1, prob = NULL) { sample(x, size = times, replace = TRUE, prob = prob) } 2.4 Roxygen Comments I’m going to take advantage of our first function to introduce Roxygen comments. As you know, the hash symbol # has a special meaning in R: you use it to indicate comments in your code. Interestingly, there is a special kind of comment called an “R oxygen” comment, or simply roxygen. As any R comment, Roxygen comments are also indicated with a hash; unlike standard comments, Roxygen comments have an appended apostrophe: #'. You use Roxygen comments to write documentation for your functions. One way to do this is by using Roxygen comments. Let’s see an example and then I will explain what’s going on with the special comments: #&#39; @title Coin toss function #&#39; @description Simulates tossing a coin a given number of times #&#39; @param x coin object (a vector) #&#39; @param times number of tosses #&#39; @param prob vector of probabilities for each side of the coin #&#39; @return vector of tosses toss &lt;- function(x, times = 1, prob = NULL) { sample(x, size = times, replace = TRUE, prob = prob) } If you type the above code in an R script, or inside a coce chunk of a dynamic document (e.g. Rmd file), you should be able to see how RStudio highlights Roxygen keywords such as @title and @description. Here’s a screenshot of what the code looks like in my machine: Notice that each keyword of the form @word appears in blue (yours may be in a different color depending on the highlighting scheme that you use). Also notice the different color of each parameter (@param) name like x, times, and prob. If you look at the code of other R packages, it is possible to find Roxygen documentation in which there is no @title and @description, something like this: #&#39; Coin toss function #&#39; #&#39; Simulates tossing a coin a given number of times #&#39; #&#39; @param x coin object (a vector) #&#39; @param times number of tosses #&#39; @param prob vector of probabilities for each side of the coin #&#39; @return vector of tosses toss &lt;- function(x, times = 1, prob = NULL) { sample(x, size = times, replace = TRUE, prob = prob) } When you see Roxygen comments like the above ones, the text in the first line is treated as the @title of the function, and then the text after the empty line is considered to be the @description. Notice how both lines of text have an empty line below them! The @return keyword is optional. But I strongly recommend including @return because it is part of a function’s documentation: tile, description, inputs, and output. # toss a loaded coin 10 times toss(coin, times = 10, prob = c(0.8, 0.2)) #&gt; [1] &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; #&gt; [9] &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; 2.4.1 About Roxygen Comments At this point you may be asking yourself: “Do I really need to document my functions with roxygen comments?” The short answer is No; you don’t. So why bother? Because royxgen comments are very convenient when you take a set of functions that will be used to build an R package. In later chapters we will describe more details about roxygen comments and roxygen keywords. The way we are going to build a package involves running some functions that will take the content of the roxygen comments and use them to generate what is called Rd (R-dcoumentation) files. These are actually the files behind all the help (or manual) documentation pages of any function. "],

We can invoke toss() to generate a first series of five tosses, and then compute the proportion of heads: # random seed set.seed(534) # five tosses five &lt;- toss(coin, times = 5) five #&gt; [1] &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;heads&quot; # prop of heads in five sum(five == &quot;heads&quot;) / length(five) #&gt; [1] 0.6 We can also get a second series of tosses, but this time involving tossing a coin six times. Similarly, we compute the proportion of heads: # six tosses six &lt;- toss(coin, times = 6) six #&gt; [1] &quot;tails&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;heads&quot; # prop of heads in six sum(six == &quot;heads&quot;) / length(five) #&gt; [1] 0.8 The above code works … except that there is an error; the number of heads in six is being divided by 5 instead of 6. R hasn’t detected this error: it doesn’t know that the division has to be done using length(six). Wouldn’t it be prefarable to have some mechanism that prevented this type of error from happening? Bugs will always be part of any programming activity, but it is better to minimize certain types of errors like the one above. 3.3 S3 Classes R has two (plus one) object oriented systems, so it can be a bit intimidatingwhen you read and learn about them for the first time. The goal of this tutorial is not to make you an expert in all R’s OOP systems, but to help you become familiar with the so-called S3 class. S3 implements a style of OO programming called generic-function OO. S3 uses a special type of function called a generic function that decides which method to call. Keep in mind that S3 is a very casual system: it does not really have a formal definition of classes. S3 classes are widely-used, in particular for statistical models in the &quot;stats&quot; package. S3 classes are very informal in that there is not a formal definition for an S3 class. Usually, S3 objects are built on top of lists, or atomic vectors with attributes. But you can also turn functions into S3 objects. Note that in more formal OOP languages, all functions are associated with a class, while in R, only some are. 3.3.1 Making an object To make an object an instance of a class, you just take an existing base object and set the &quot;class&quot; attribute. You can do that during creation of the object with structure() # object coin via structure() coin1 &lt;- structure(c(&quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;), class = &quot;coin&quot;) coin1 #&gt; [1] &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; #&gt; attr(,&quot;class&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;coin&quot; You can also create an object first, and then specify its class with the function class(): # object coin via class() coin2 &lt;- c(&quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;) class(coin2) &lt;- &quot;coin&quot; coin2 #&gt; [1] &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; #&gt; attr(,&quot;class&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;coin&quot; As any object in R, you can inspect the class coin1, and coin2 with the class() function: class(coin1) #&gt; [1] &quot;coin&quot; class(coin2) #&gt; [1] &quot;coin&quot; You can also determine if an object inherits from a specific class using inherits() inherits(coin2, &quot;coin&quot;) #&gt; [1] TRUE Having a &quot;coin&quot; object, we can pass it to the toss() function to simulate flipping the coin: toss(coin1, times = 5) #&gt; [1] &quot;tails&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; 3.4 A more robust &quot;coin&quot; class Let’s review our class &quot;coin&quot;. The way we defined a coin object was like this: # object coin coin1 &lt;- c(&quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;) class(coin1) &lt;- &quot;coin&quot; While this definition is good to illustrate the concept of an object, its class, and how to define generic methods, it is a very loose-defined class. One could create a &quot;coin&quot; out of c('tic', 'tac', 'toe'), and then use toss() on it: ttt &lt;- c(&#39;tic&#39;, &#39;tac&#39;, &#39;toe&#39;) class(ttt) &lt;- &quot;coin&quot; toss(ttt) #&gt; [1] &quot;tic&quot; We need a more formal definition of a coin. For instance, it makes more sense to require that a coin should only have two sides. In this way, the vector ttt would not be a valid coin. For convenience purposes, we can define a class constructor function to initialize a &quot;coin&quot; object: coin &lt;- function(object = c(&quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;)) { class(object) &lt;- &quot;coin&quot; object } # default coin coin() #&gt; [1] &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; #&gt; attr(,&quot;class&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;coin&quot; # another coin coin(c(&quot;h&quot;, &quot;t&quot;)) #&gt; [1] &quot;h&quot; &quot;t&quot; #&gt; attr(,&quot;class&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;coin&quot; 3.5 Improving &quot;coin&quot; objects To implement the requirement that a coin must have two sides, we can check for the length of the input vector: coin &lt;- function(object = c(&quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;)) { if (length(object) != 2) { stop(&quot;\\n&#39;object&#39; must be of length 2&quot;) } class(object) &lt;- &quot;coin&quot; object } Let’s try our modified coin() function to create a US penny like the one in the image below: Figure 3.1: US Penny (www.usacoinbook.com) # US penny penny &lt;- coin(c(&quot;lincoln&quot;, &quot;shield&quot;)) penny #&gt; [1] &quot;lincoln&quot; &quot;shield&quot; #&gt; attr(,&quot;class&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;coin&quot; Now let’s try coin() with an invalid input vector: # invalid coin ttt &lt;- c(&#39;tic&#39;, &#39;tac&#39;, &#39;toe&#39;) coin(ttt) #&gt; Error in coin(ttt): #&gt; &#39;object&#39; must be of length 2 Because the toss() function simulates flips using sample(), we can take advantage of the argument prob to specify probabilities for each side of the coin. In this way, we can create loaded (i.e. biased) coins. The way we are going to keep the probability of each side of the coin is with the use an objetc’s attributes. An example of an attribute is the class of an object. For example the class of our &quot;coin&quot; objects: penny #&gt; [1] &quot;lincoln&quot; &quot;shield&quot; #&gt; attr(,&quot;class&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;coin&quot; Notice how everytime you print the name of a &quot;coin&quot; object, its class is displayed in the form of attr(,&quot;class&quot;). 3.5.1 Attributes In addition to the class attribute of a coin, the idea is to assign another attribute for the probability values. We can do this by adding a prob argument to the constructor function, and then pass it as an attribute of the coin object inside the class-constructor function. coin &lt;- function(object = c(&quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;), prob = c(0.5, 0.5)) { if (length(object) != 2) { stop(&quot;\\n&#39;object&#39; must be of length 2&quot;) } attr(object, &quot;prob&quot;) &lt;- prob class(object) &lt;- &quot;coin&quot; return(object) } coin() #&gt; [1] &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; #&gt; attr(,&quot;prob&quot;) #&gt; [1] 0.5 0.5 #&gt; attr(,&quot;class&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;coin&quot; In the previous code, the prob argument takes a vector of probabilities for each element in object. This vector is passed to object via the function attr() inside the body of coin(). Notice the use of a default prob = c(0.5, 0.5), that is, a fair coin by default. 3.5.2 Using a list Another way to implement a constructor function coin() that returns an object containing values for both the sides and the probabilities, is to use an R list. Here’s the code for this option: coin &lt;- function(sides = c(&quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;), prob = c(0.5, 0.5)) { if (length(sides) != 2) { stop(&quot;\\n&#39;sides&#39; must be of length 2&quot;) } res &lt;- list(sides = sides, prob = prob) class(res) &lt;- &quot;coin&quot; return(res) } coin() #&gt; $sides #&gt; [1] &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $prob #&gt; [1] 0.5 0.5 #&gt; #&gt; attr(,&quot;class&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;coin&quot; 3.5.3 Auxiliary Checker Once again, we need to check for the validity of prob. We basically need to check that prob and its elements meet the following requirements: must be numeric and of length 2 probability values must be between 0 and 1 the sum of these values must add up to 1 Here is one possible function to check the aspects of prob listed above: check_prob &lt;- function(prob) { if (length(prob) != 2 | !is.numeric(prob)) { stop(&quot;\\n&#39;prob&#39; must be a numeric vector of length 2&quot;) } if (any(prob &lt; 0) | any(prob &gt; 1)) { stop(&quot;\\n&#39;prob&#39; values must be between 0 and 1&quot;) } if (sum(prob) != 1) { stop(&quot;\\nelements in &#39;prob&#39; must add up to 1&quot;) } TRUE } Note that I’m adding a TRUE statement at the end of the function. This is just an auxiliary value to know if the function returns a valid prob. Now let’s test it with valid and invalid values: # Valid ----------------------- check_prob(c(0.5, 0.5)) #&gt; [1] TRUE check_prob(c(0.1, 0.9)) #&gt; [1] TRUE check_prob(c(1/3, 2/3)) #&gt; [1] TRUE check_prob(c(1/3, 6/9)) #&gt; [1] TRUE # Invalid ----------------------- # bad length check_prob(1) #&gt; Error in check_prob(1): #&gt; &#39;prob&#39; must be a numeric vector of length 2 # bad length check_prob(c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3)) #&gt; Error in check_prob(c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3)): #&gt; &#39;prob&#39; must be a numeric vector of length 2 # negative probability check_prob(c(-0.2, 0.8)) #&gt; Error in check_prob(c(-0.2, 0.8)): #&gt; &#39;prob&#39; values must be between 0 and 1 # what should we do in this case? check_prob(c(0.33, 0.66)) #&gt; Error in check_prob(c(0.33, 0.66)): #&gt; elements in &#39;prob&#39; must add up to 1 Here’s the improved constructor function coin(): coin &lt;- function(sides = c(&quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;), prob = c(0.5, 0.5)) { if (length(sides) != 2) { stop(&quot;\\n&#39;sides&#39; must be of length 2&quot;) } check_prob(prob) res &lt;- list(sides = sides, prob = prob) class(res) &lt;- &quot;coin&quot; return(res) } coin1 &lt;- coin() coin1 #&gt; $sides #&gt; [1] &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $prob #&gt; [1] 0.5 0.5 #&gt; #&gt; attr(,&quot;class&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;coin&quot; 3.6 Print Method for &quot;coin&quot; Every time you type in the name of an object &quot;coin&quot;, like our penny example, the output is displayed in a default, “quick and dirty”, way. R displays the values associated to the sides and their probabilities like any other list: # US penny penny &lt;- coin(c(&quot;lincoln&quot;, &quot;shield&quot;)) penny #&gt; $sides #&gt; [1] &quot;lincoln&quot; &quot;shield&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $prob #&gt; [1] 0.5 0.5 #&gt; #&gt; attr(,&quot;class&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;coin&quot; Sometimes the default displayed output is all you need. However, there are occasions in which you need to customize the amount and format of information displayed on the screen when you type in the name of an object. Instead of keeping the default printed values, it would be nice to print penny and see some output like this: object &quot;coin&quot; side prob 1 &quot;lincoln&quot; 0.5 2 &quot;shield&quot; 0.5 How can we do this? The answer involves writing a print method for objects of class &quot;coin&quot;. Because print() is actually a generic function, what you need to do is to create a a specific print flavor for class coin. Basically, you define a print.coin() function, and then include commands to print information in the desired way: print.coin &lt;- function(x) { cat(&#39;object &quot;coin&quot;\\n\\n&#39;) cd &lt;- data.frame( side = x$sides, prob = x$prob ) print(cd) invisible(x) } Now, the next time you print the name of an object of class &quot;coin&quot;, R will look for a print method (which now exists) and dispatch such method. penny #&gt; object &quot;coin&quot; #&gt; #&gt; side prob #&gt; 1 lincoln 0.5 #&gt; 2 shield 0.5 3.7 Extending classes We can extend the class &quot;coin&quot; and create a derived class for special types of coins. For instance, say we want to create a class &quot;quarter&quot;. One side of the coin refers to George Washington, while the other side refers to John Brown’s Fort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter_(United_States_coin) quarter1 &lt;- coin(c(&quot;washington&quot;, &quot;fort&quot;)) class(quarter1) &lt;- c(&quot;quarter&quot;, &quot;coin&quot;) quarter1 #&gt; object &quot;coin&quot; #&gt; #&gt; side prob #&gt; 1 washington 0.5 #&gt; 2 fort 0.5 Our coin quarter1 inherits from &quot;coin&quot;: inherits(quarter1, &quot;coin&quot;) #&gt; [1] TRUE Likewise, we can create a class for a slightly unbalanced &quot;dime&quot;: dime1 &lt;- coin(c(&quot;roosevelt&quot;, &quot;torch&quot;), prob = c(0.48, 0.52)) class(dime1) &lt;- c(&quot;dime&quot;, &quot;coin&quot;) dime1 #&gt; object &quot;coin&quot; #&gt; #&gt; side prob #&gt; 1 roosevelt 0.48 #&gt; 2 torch 0.52 Here’s another coin example, a peso, from Mexico (where I grew up). When you flip a peso, you have two sides: aguila (eagle) or sol (sun): peso &lt;- coin(c(&quot;aguila&quot;, &quot;sol&quot;)) class(peso) &lt;- c(&quot;peso&quot;, &quot;coin&quot;) peso #&gt; object &quot;coin&quot; #&gt; #&gt; side prob #&gt; 1 aguila 0.5 #&gt; 2 sol 0.5 "],
["methods1.html", "4 Methods (part 1) 4.1 Introduction 4.2 Improving toss() 4.3 Generic Method toss", " 4 Methods (part 1) 4.1 Introduction We describe our methods in this chapter. 4.2 Improving toss() From chapter 2, we ended up with the following toss() function: #&#39; @title Coin toss function #&#39; @description Simulates tossing a coin a given number of times #&#39; @param x coin object #&#39; @param times number of tosses #&#39; @param prob vector of probabilities for each side of the coin #&#39; @return vector of tosses toss &lt;- function(x, times = 1, prob = NULL) { sample(x, size = times, replace = TRUE, prob = prob) } The issue with the way toss() has been defined so far, is that you can pass it any type of vector (not necessarily of class &quot;coin&quot;), and it will still work: toss(c(&#39;tic&#39;, &#39;tac&#39;, &#39;toe&#39;)) #&gt; [1] &quot;tac&quot; To create a function toss() that only works for objects of class &quot;coin&quot;, we could add a stop() condition that checks if the argument x is of the right class: toss &lt;- function(x, times = 1, prob = NULL) { if (class(x) != &quot;coin&quot;) { stop(&quot;\\ntoss() requires an object &#39;coin&#39;&quot;) } sample(x$sides, size = times, replace = TRUE, prob = prob) } # ok toss(coin1) #&gt; [1] &quot;heads&quot; # bad coin toss(c(&#39;tic&#39;, &#39;tac&#39;, &#39;toe&#39;)) #&gt; Error in toss(c(&quot;tic&quot;, &quot;tac&quot;, &quot;toe&quot;)): #&gt; toss() requires an object &#39;coin&#39; A more formal strategy, and one that follows OOP principles, is to create a toss method. In R, many functions are actually methods: e.g. print(), summary(), plot(), str(), etc. # print method print #&gt; function (x, ...) #&gt; UseMethod(&quot;print&quot;) #&gt; &lt;bytecode: 0x7fa473aa7628&gt; #&gt; &lt;environment: namespace:base&gt; These types of functions are not really one unique function, they typically comprise a collection or family of functions for printing objects, computing summaries, plotting, etc. Depending on the class of the object, a generic method will look for a specific function for that class: # methods for objects &quot;matrix&quot; methods(class = &quot;matrix&quot;) #&gt; [1] anyDuplicated as.data.frame as.raster boxplot determinant #&gt; [6] duplicated edit head isSymmetric relist #&gt; [11] subset summary tail unique #&gt; see &#39;?methods&#39; for accessing help and source code 4.3 Generic Method toss When implementing new methods, you begin by creating a generic method with the function UseMethod(): toss &lt;- function(x, ...) UseMethod(&quot;toss&quot;) The function UseMethod() allows you to declare the name of a method. In this example we are telling R that the function toss() is now a generic &quot;toss&quot; method. Note the use of &quot;...&quot; in the function definition, this will allow you to include more arguments when you define specific methods based on &quot;toss&quot;. A generic method alone is not very useful. You need to create specific cases for the generic. In our example, we only have one class &quot;coin&quot;,so that is the only class we will allow toss to be applied on. The way to do this is by defining toss.coin(): toss.coin &lt;- function(x, times = 1, prob = NULL) { sample(x$sides, size = times, replace = TRUE, prob = prob) } The name of the method, &quot;toss&quot;, comes first, followed by a dot &quot;.&quot;, followed by the name of the class, &quot;coin&quot;. Notice that the body of the function toss.coin() does not include the stop() command anymore. To use the toss() method on a &quot;coin&quot; object, you don’t really have to call toss.coin(); calling toss() is enough: toss(coin1) #&gt; [1] &quot;tails&quot; How does toss() work? Becasue toss() is now a generic method, everytime you use it, R will look at the class of the input, and see if there is an associated &quot;toss&quot; method. In the previous example, coin1 is an object of class &quot;coin&quot;, for which there is a specific toss.coin() method. Thus using toss() on a &quot;coin&quot; object works fine. Now let’s try toss() on the character vector c('tic', 'tac', 'toe'): # no toss() method for regular vectors toss(c(&#39;tic&#39;, &#39;tac&#39;, &#39;toe&#39;)) #&gt; Error in UseMethod(&quot;toss&quot;): no applicable method for &#39;toss&#39; applied to an object of class &quot;character&quot; When you try to use toss() on an object that is not of class &quot;coin&quot;, you get a nice error message. Because an object &quot;coin&quot; already contains an element prob, the toss.coin() function does not really an argument prob. Instead, we can pass this value from the coin object. Here’s a new definition of toss.coin(): toss.coin &lt;- function(x, times = 1) { sample(x$sides, size = times, replace = TRUE, prob = x$prob) } Let’s toss a loaded coin: set.seed(2341) loaded_coin &lt;- coin(c(&#39;HEADS&#39;, &#39;tails&#39;), prob = c(0.75, 0.25)) toss(loaded_coin, times = 6) #&gt; [1] &quot;HEADS&quot; &quot;HEADS&quot; &quot;HEADS&quot; &quot;HEADS&quot; &quot;HEADS&quot; &quot;tails&quot; "],

Consequently, it would be nice to have another class of object for this purpose. How do you know that you need this new object class? Well, this is precisely an example that illustrates the process of programming in general, and OOP in particular. This kind of decisions require some (or sometimes “a lot” of) thinking, and brainstorming time. To be honest, while I was writing this book and playing with &quot;coin&quot; objects and their tosses, I decided that it would be convenient to have an object of class &quot;toss&quot; containing the following information: all the outcomes from the series of tosses the total number of tosses the total number of heads the total number of tails The most flexible type of data structure in R to store other data structures is a list. Having a vector of tosses, we can use a list to keep all the desired information: flips &lt;- toss(coin1, times = 6) a &lt;- list( tosses = flips, total = length(flips), heads = sum(flips == coin1$sides[1]), tails = sum(flips == coin1$sides[2]) ) a #&gt; $tosses #&gt; [1] &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;tails&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $total #&gt; [1] 6 #&gt; #&gt; $heads #&gt; [1] 3 #&gt; #&gt; $tails #&gt; [1] 3 The idea is to be able to invoke toss(), and then obtain an object like the list a in the above code. But do it in such a way that the output is an object of class &quot;toss&quot;. 5.2.1 Auxiliary Constructor For convenience purposes, we can write an auxiliary constructor function, which I will call make_toss(). This function will take an input vector (i.e. a character vector with &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;tails&quot; elements), and it will return an object of class &quot;toss&quot;: # auxiliary constructor function make_toss &lt;- function(coin, flips) { res &lt;- list( coin = coin, tosses = flips, total = length(flips), heads = sum(flips == coin$sides[1]), tails = sum(flips == coin$sides[2])) class(res) &lt;- &quot;toss&quot; res } 5.3 Main Function toss() Now that we have the auxiliary function make_toss(), we can encapsulate it in a master function toss.coin(): toss.coin &lt;- function(x, times = 1) { flips &lt;- sample(x$sides, size = times, replace = TRUE, prob = x$prob) make_toss(x, flips) } This is how toss() works: set.seed(2233) fair &lt;- coin() toss(fair, times = 5) #&gt; $coin #&gt; object &quot;coin&quot; #&gt; #&gt; side prob #&gt; 1 heads 0.5 #&gt; 2 tails 0.5 #&gt; #&gt; $tosses #&gt; [1] &quot;tails&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;tails&quot; &quot;heads&quot; &quot;heads&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $total #&gt; [1] 5 #&gt; #&gt; $heads #&gt; [1] 2 #&gt; #&gt; $tails #&gt; [1] 3 #&gt; #&gt; attr(,&quot;class&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;toss&quot; You may ask: “Why do we need a function make_toss(), and another function toss()?”. Can’t we just write a single function suppertoss() that does everything at once?: # can&#39;t we just put everything in one function? supertoss &lt;- function(x, times = 1) { flips &lt;- toss(x, times = times) res &lt;- list( coin = x, tosses = flips, total = length(flips), heads = sum(flips == x$sides[1]), tails = sum(flips == x$sides[2])) class(res) &lt;- &quot;toss&quot; res } The short answer is: yes, you can. And probably this is what most beginners tend to do. The reason why I decided to break things down into simpler and smaller functions is because I went already through a couple of implementations, and realized that it was better to have the auxiliary function make_toss(). Also, it is good practice to write short functions that preferably do one thing. Here’s a brief recap of the main functions we have so far: coin() is a constructor function to create objects of class &quot;coin&quot;. toss() is a generic &quot;toss&quot; method. make_toss() is an auxiliary function that takes a &quot;coin&quot; and a vector of flips, and which produces an object &quot;toss&quot;. toss.coin() is the specific &quot;toss&quot; method to be used on &quot;coin&quot; objects. 5.4 Upgrading toss() Let’s consider our quarter coin, and apply toss() on it: quarter1 &lt;- coin(c(&quot;washington&quot;, &quot;fort&quot;)) class(quarter1) &lt;- c(&quot;quarter&quot;, &quot;coin&quot;) quarter1 #&gt; object &quot;coin&quot; #&gt; #&gt; side prob #&gt; 1 washington 0.5 #&gt; 2 fort 0.5 toss(quarter1, times = 4) #&gt; $coin #&gt; object &quot;coin&quot; #&gt; #&gt; side prob #&gt; 1 washington 0.5 #&gt; 2 fort 0.5 #&gt; #&gt; $tosses #&gt; [1] &quot;washington&quot; &quot;washington&quot; &quot;fort&quot; &quot;washington&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $total #&gt; [1] 4 #&gt; #&gt; $heads #&gt; [1] 3 #&gt; #&gt; $tails #&gt; [1] 1 #&gt; #&gt; attr(,&quot;class&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;toss&quot; toss() is working as expected, and you can try it with different values for times. The only issue is that a distracted user could pass an unexpected value for the argument times: toss(quarter1, times = -4) #&gt; Error in sample.int(length(x), size, replace, prob): invalid &#39;size&#39; argument R produces an error when times = -4, but it’s an error that may not be very helpful for the user. The error message clearly says that 'size' is an invalid argument, but toss() just has one argument: times. To be more user friendly, among other reasons, it would be better to check whether times has a valid value. One way to do that is to include a conditional statement like the following one: toss.coin &lt;- function(x, times = 1) { if (times &lt;= 0) { stop(&quot;\\nargument &#39;times&#39; must be a positive integer&quot;) } flips &lt;- sample(x$sides, size = times, replace = TRUE, prob = x$prob) make_toss(x, flips) } # this works ok toss(quarter1, 5) #&gt; $coin #&gt; object &quot;coin&quot; #&gt; #&gt; side prob #&gt; 1 washington 0.5 #&gt; 2 fort 0.5 #&gt; #&gt; $tosses #&gt; [1] &quot;fort&quot; &quot;fort&quot; &quot;washington&quot; &quot;washington&quot; &quot;fort&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $total #&gt; [1] 5 #&gt; #&gt; $heads #&gt; [1] 2 #&gt; #&gt; $tails #&gt; [1] 3 #&gt; #&gt; attr(,&quot;class&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;toss&quot; # this doesn&#39;t work, but the error message is clear toss(quarter1, -4) #&gt; Error in toss.coin(quarter1, -4): #&gt; argument &#39;times&#39; must be a positive integer Once again, it is good practice to write short functions that preferably do one thing. In this case, we could define a checking function check_times() to make sure that times has a valid value: # auxiliary function to check &#39;times&#39; input check_times &lt;- function(times) { if (times &lt;= 0 | !is.numeric(times)) { stop(&quot;\\nargument &#39;times&#39; must be a positive integer&quot;) } else { TRUE } } Once check_times() has been defined, we can include it inside toss(): toss.coin &lt;- function(x, times = 1) { check_times(times) flips &lt;- sample(x$sides, size = times, replace = TRUE, prob = x$prob) make_toss(x, flips) } toss(quarter1, 5) #&gt; $coin #&gt; object &quot;coin&quot; #&gt; #&gt; side prob #&gt; 1 washington 0.5 #&gt; 2 fort 0.5 #&gt; #&gt; $tosses #&gt; [1] &quot;washington&quot; &quot;washington&quot; &quot;fort&quot; &quot;fort&quot; &quot;fort&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $total #&gt; [1] 5 #&gt; #&gt; $heads #&gt; [1] 2 #&gt; #&gt; $tails #&gt; [1] 3 #&gt; #&gt; attr(,&quot;class&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;toss&quot; 5.4.1 In Summary The more you understand a problem (i.e. phenomenon, process), the better you will be prepared to design objects, and program their corresponding methods.

Right now this type of output is basically a list. For instance, consider a Mexican peso with two sides: aguila and sol. And let’s use toss() to flip a peso 15 times. Figure 6.1: An old Mexican peso (www.coinfactswiki.com) By the way, flips are commonly referred to as volados in Mexico: set.seed(789) peso &lt;- coin(c(&#39;aguila&#39;, &#39;sol&#39;)) volados &lt;- toss(peso, 15) volados #&gt; $coin #&gt; object &quot;coin&quot; #&gt; #&gt; side prob #&gt; 1 aguila 0.5 #&gt; 2 sol 0.5 #&gt; #&gt; $tosses #&gt; [1] &quot;aguila&quot; &quot;sol&quot; &quot;sol&quot; &quot;aguila&quot; &quot;sol&quot; &quot;sol&quot; &quot;aguila&quot; #&gt; [8] &quot;sol&quot; &quot;sol&quot; &quot;sol&quot; &quot;sol&quot; &quot;aguila&quot; &quot;sol&quot; &quot;sol&quot; #&gt; [15] &quot;sol&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $total #&gt; [1] 15 #&gt; #&gt; $heads #&gt; [1] 4 #&gt; #&gt; $tails #&gt; [1] 11 #&gt; #&gt; attr(,&quot;class&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;toss&quot; Every time you type in the name of an object &quot;toss&quot;, like volados in the previous example, the output is displayed like any other list. R displays the values of $coin and its attributes (attr), the $tosses, the $total, the number of $heads and $tails, and finally the class attribute. Instead of displaying all the elements that are in the output list returned by toss(), it would be more convenient to display information in a more compact way, for instance some sort of text containing the following bullets: object “toss” coin: “aguila”, “sol” total tosses: 15 num of aguila: 11 num of sol: 4 Typically, most classes in R have a dedicated printing method. Depending on the type of object, the default printed information may consist of a couple of lines, or sometimes a very verbose output. To create such a method we use the generic function print(). To be more precise, we declare a new print method for objects of class &quot;toss&quot; like so: # print method for object of class &quot;toss&quot; print.toss &lt;- function(x, ...) { cat(&#39;object &quot;toss&quot;\\n&#39;) cat(sprintf(&#39;sides: &quot;%s&quot;, &quot;%s&quot;&#39;, x$coin$sides[1], x$coin$sides[2]), &quot;\\n&quot;) cat(sprintf(&#39;prob: &quot;%s&quot;, &quot;%s&quot;&#39;, x$coin$prob[1], x$coin$prob[2]), &quot;\\n&quot;) cat(&quot;total tosses:&quot;, x$total, &quot;\\n&quot;) cat(sprintf(&quot;num of %s:&quot;, x$coin$sides[1]), x$heads, &quot;\\n&quot;) cat(sprintf(&quot;num of %s:&quot;, x$coin$sides[2]), x$tails, &quot;\\n&quot;) invisible(x) } By convention, print methods return the value of their principal argument invisibly. The invisible function turns off automatic printing, thus preventing an infinite recursion when printing is done implicitly at the session level. After a print method has been defined for an object &quot;toss&quot;, everytime you type an object of such class, R will search for the corresponding method and display the output accordingly: # testing print method set.seed(789) volados &lt;- toss(peso, 15) volados #&gt; object &quot;toss&quot; #&gt; sides: &quot;aguila&quot;, &quot;sol&quot; #&gt; prob: &quot;0.5&quot;, &quot;0.5&quot; #&gt; total tosses: 15 #&gt; num of aguila: 4 #&gt; num of sol: 11 Here’s another example with the quarter1 coin used in previous chapters: set.seed(555) quarter1 &lt;- coin(c(&quot;washington&quot;, &quot;fort&quot;)) quarter_flips &lt;- toss(quarter1, 50) quarter_flips #&gt; object &quot;toss&quot; #&gt; sides: &quot;washington&quot;, &quot;fort&quot; #&gt; prob: &quot;0.5&quot;, &quot;0.5&quot; #&gt; total tosses: 50 #&gt; num of washington: 20 #&gt; num of fort: 30 6.3 Summary Method For most purposes the standard print method will be sufficient output. However, sometimes a more extensive display is required. This can be done with a summary function. To define this type of method we use the function summary(). The way you declare a summary method is similar to the way you declare print. You need to specify summary.toss, indicating that there will be a new summary method for objects of class &quot;toss&quot;. The summary will return an object of class &quot;summary.toss&quot;, which is typically a list (although you can return any other type of data object). There’s actually one more method that you typically have to create in addition to summary: a sibling print.summary method. The reason why you need these pair of methods is because an object &quot;summary.toss&quot;—returned by summary()—will very likely need its own print method, thus requiring a print.summary.toss() function. Here’s the summary.toss() and the print.summary.toss() functions: summary.toss &lt;- function(object) { structure(object, class = c(&quot;summary.toss&quot;, class(object))) } print.summary.toss &lt;- function(x, ...) { cat(&#39;summary &quot;toss&quot;\\n\\n&#39;) cat(sprintf(&#39;coin: &quot;%s&quot;, &quot;%s&quot;&#39;, x$coin[1], x$coin[2]), &quot;\\n&quot;) cat(&quot;total tosses:&quot;, x$total, &quot;\\n\\n&quot;) cat(sprintf(&quot;num of %s:&quot;, x$coin$sides[1]), x$heads, &quot;\\n&quot;) cat(sprintf(&quot;prop of %s:&quot;, x$coin$sides[1]), x$heads/x$total, &quot;\\n\\n&quot;) cat(sprintf(&quot;num of %s:&quot;, x$coin$sides[2]), x$tails, &quot;\\n&quot;) cat(sprintf(&quot;prop of %s:&quot;, x$coin$sides[2]), x$tails/x$total, &quot;\\n&quot;) invisible(x) } Let’s test it: summary(quarter_flips) #&gt; summary &quot;toss&quot; #&gt; #&gt; coin: &quot;c(&quot;washington&quot;, &quot;fort&quot;)&quot;, &quot;c(0.5, 0.5)&quot; #&gt; total tosses: 50 #&gt; #&gt; num of washington: 20 #&gt; prop of washington: 0.4 #&gt; #&gt; num of fort: 30 #&gt; prop of fort: 0.6 You can actually store the output of summary() and inspect its contents: quater_sum &lt;- summary(quarter_flips) names(quarter_sum) #&gt; Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;quarter_sum&#39; not found 6.4 Plot Method We can also define a plot method for objects of class &quot;toss&quot;: What we want to plot of an object &quot;toss&quot; is the series of realtive frequencies (of either &quot;heads&quot; ot &quot;tails&quot;). This means we need to create a couple of auxiliary functions: head_freqs &lt;- function(x) { cumsum(x$tosses == x$coin$sides[1]) / 1:x$total } tail_freqs &lt;- function(x) { cumsum(x$tosses == x$coin$sides[2]) / 1:x$total } frequencies &lt;- function(x, side = 1) { if (side == 1) { return(head_freqs(x)) } else { return(tail_freqs(x)) } } Here’s one way to define a plot() method for &quot;toss&quot; objects: plot.toss &lt;- function(x, side = 1, ...) { freqs &lt;- frequencies(x, side = side) plot(1:x$total, freqs, type = &quot;n&quot;, ylim = c(0, 1), las = 1, xlab = &quot;number of tosses&quot;, bty = &quot;n&quot;, ylab = sprintf(&quot;relative frequency of %s&quot;, x$coin$sides[side])) abline(h = 0.5, col = &quot;gray70&quot;, lwd = 1.5) lines(1:x$total, freqs, col = &quot;tomato&quot;, lwd = 2) title(sprintf(&quot;Relative Frequencies in a series of %s coin tosses&quot;, x$total)) } Let’s test our plot method: plot(quarter_flips) "],

However, we can add more common (and not so common) methods such as: replacement: &quot;[&lt;-.toss&quot; extraction: &quot;[.toss&quot; testing: is.toss() addition: &quot;+.toss&quot; 7.2 Replacement Method Replacement functions are those calls like x[1] &lt;- 3. The function behind this expression is the replacement &quot;[&lt;-&quot;() function. We can also create a replacement function for a given class using the notation &quot;[&lt;-.class&quot;, where class is the name of the class: &quot;[&lt;-.toss&quot; &lt;- function(x, i, value) { if (value != x$coin$sides[1] &amp; value != x$coin$sides[2]) { stop(sprintf(&#39;\\nreplacing value must be %s or %s&#39;, x$coin$sides[1], x$coin$sides[2])) } x$tosses[i] &lt;- value make_toss(x$coin, x$tosses) } Test it: set.seed(3752) dime1 &lt;- coin(c(&quot;roosevelt&quot;, &quot;torch&quot;), prob = c(0.48, 0.52)) b &lt;- toss(dime1, times = 5) b$tosses #&gt; [1] &quot;roosevelt&quot; &quot;roosevelt&quot; &quot;roosevelt&quot; &quot;torch&quot; &quot;torch&quot; # replacement b[1] &lt;- &quot;torch&quot; b$tosses #&gt; [1] &quot;torch&quot; &quot;roosevelt&quot; &quot;roosevelt&quot; &quot;torch&quot; &quot;torch&quot; What about replacing out of the original range? # replacement in sixth position (weird!) b[6] &lt;- &quot;torch&quot; b #&gt; object &quot;toss&quot; #&gt; sides: &quot;roosevelt&quot;, &quot;torch&quot; #&gt; prob: &quot;0.48&quot;, &quot;0.52&quot; #&gt; total tosses: 6 #&gt; num of roosevelt: 2 #&gt; num of torch: 4 Or something like this? # replacement b[10] &lt;- &quot;torch&quot; b #&gt; object &quot;toss&quot; #&gt; sides: &quot;roosevelt&quot;, &quot;torch&quot; #&gt; prob: &quot;0.48&quot;, &quot;0.52&quot; #&gt; total tosses: 10 #&gt; num of roosevelt: NA #&gt; num of torch: NA Because, in general, it does not make sense to replace if index is out of the original length, we can add a stop() condition: &quot;[&lt;-.toss&quot; &lt;- function(x, i, value) { if (value != x$coin$sides[1] &amp; value != x$coin$sides[2]) { stop(sprintf(&#39;\\nreplacing value must be %s or %s&#39;, x$coin$sides[1], x$coin$sides[2])) } if (i &gt; x$total) { stop(&quot;\\nindex out of bounds&quot;) } x$tosses[i] &lt;- value make_toss(x$coin, x$tosses) } Now we cannot replace if index is out of the original length: set.seed(3752) b &lt;- toss(dime1, times = 5) b$tosses #&gt; [1] &quot;roosevelt&quot; &quot;roosevelt&quot; &quot;roosevelt&quot; &quot;torch&quot; &quot;torch&quot; # replacement b[10] &lt;- &quot;torch&quot; #&gt; Error in `[&lt;-.toss`(`*tmp*`, 10, value = &quot;torch&quot;): #&gt; index out of bounds 7.3 Extraction Method What if you want to know what is the value of toss in position 3? You could type something like this: b$tosses[3] #&gt; [1] &quot;roosevelt&quot; Or you could create an extraction method that allows you to type x[3]. The function behind this expression is the extraction &quot;[&quot;() function. We can also create a extraction function for a given class. &quot;[.toss&quot; &lt;- function(x, i) { x$tosses[i] } Test it: set.seed(3752) b &lt;- toss(dime1, times = 5) b$tosses #&gt; [1] &quot;roosevelt&quot; &quot;roosevelt&quot; &quot;roosevelt&quot; &quot;torch&quot; &quot;torch&quot; b[1] #&gt; [1] &quot;roosevelt&quot; 7.4 Is &quot;toss&quot; Another common type of function for an object of a given class is is.class()-like functions: e.g. is.list(), is.numeric(), is.matrix(). This type of functions allow you to test or check whether an object is of a given class. We can create our own is.toss() to check whether a given R object is of class &quot;coss&quot;. Here’s how to define such a function: is.toss &lt;- function(x) { inherits(x, &quot;toss&quot;) } is.toss(b) #&gt; [1] TRUE is.toss(c(&quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;)) #&gt; [1] FALSE 7.5 Addition Method R comes with generic Math methods (see ?Math). Among these generic methods we can find the &quot;+&quot; operator. This means that we can define our own plus method for objects of class &quot;toss&quot;. The idea is to be able to call a command like this: # toss object b &lt;- toss(dime1, times = 5) # add 5 more flips b + 5 Here’s one implementation of &quot;+.toss()&quot; in which the first argument is an object of class &quot;toss&quot;, and the second argument is a single positive number that will play the role of additional tosses: &quot;+.toss&quot; &lt;- function(obj, incr) { if (length(incr) != 1 | incr &lt;= 0) { stop(&quot;\\ninvalid increament (must be positive)&quot;) } more_flips &lt;- toss(obj$coin, times = incr) make_toss(obj$coin, c(obj$tosses, more_flips$tosses)) } Remember that &quot;+&quot; is a binary operator, which means that writing a &quot;+&quot; method requires a function with two arguments. Let’s try it: # add four more tosses mycoin &lt;- coin() seven &lt;- toss(mycoin, times = 7) seven #&gt; object &quot;toss&quot; #&gt; sides: &quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot; #&gt; prob: &quot;0.5&quot;, &quot;0.5&quot; #&gt; total tosses: 7 #&gt; num of heads: 4 #&gt; num of tails: 3 Let’s add a couple of more tosses to seven: # two more flips seven + 2 #&gt; object &quot;toss&quot; #&gt; sides: &quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot; #&gt; prob: &quot;0.5&quot;, &quot;0.5&quot; #&gt; total tosses: 9 #&gt; num of heads: 4 #&gt; num of tails: 5 # three more flips seven + 3 #&gt; object &quot;toss&quot; #&gt; sides: &quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot; #&gt; prob: &quot;0.5&quot;, &quot;0.5&quot; #&gt; total tosses: 10 #&gt; num of heads: 6 #&gt; num of tails: 4 "],

Notice the default R script hello.R and the file structure in the Files tab: 8.3 Minimal Filestructure If you look at pane with the Files tab, you should be able to see the following files and directories: Figure 8.4: Minimal filestructure created by devtools We’ve ended up with six components inside the package folder. Here’s the description of each file: DESCRIPTION is a text file (with no extension) that has metadata for your package. Simply put, this file is like the business card of your package. NAMESPACE is a text file (also with no extension) that is used to list the functions that will be available to be called by the user. The R/ directory which is where you store all the R script files with the functions of the package. cointoss.Rproj is an RStudio project file that is designed to make your package easy to use with RStudio. .Rbuildignore is a hidden text file used to specify files to be ignored by R when building the tar-ball or bundle of the package. 8.4 Quick Build With the hello world content automatically created by devtools, you can quickly build a tiny package. In this case, there’s only one function, the hello() function, that simply prints a hi message. If you inspect the content of the file hello.R (inside the R/ directory), you will see some comments suggesting a list of steps and their keyboard shortcuts: Build and Reload Package: Cmd + Shift + B Check Package: Cmd + Shift + E Test Package: Cmd + Shift + T Alternatively, if you go to the Build tab, you will find the Install and Restart button, the Check button, and the More menu with additional building options.

["description.html", "10 Description File 10.1 Introduction 10.2 Sample Description 10.3 Mandatory Fields 10.4 Optional Fields", " 10 Description File 10.1 Introduction Every package needs a DESCRIPTION file. This is just a text file containing the metadata about your package. In other words, this type of file contains a set of specifications describing important aspects about your package. In this chapter we discuss some of the main fields in the DESCRIPTION file. 10.2 Sample Description When creating an “off-the-shelf” package, like the hello world example, the file DESCRIPTION will contain some default lines: Figure 10.1: Typical default content in a DESCRIPTION file Although the DESCRIPTION file is a text with no file extension, it does follow a special type of format known as a Debian Control File: https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/index.html#document-ch-controlfields If you take a peek at the content of the DESCRIPTION file, you will see that all its fields start with a name immediately followed by a colon :, followed by a space, and then the corresponding value of the field. Notice that all field names are capitalized. Also, keep in mind that field names are case-sensitive! Likewise, when the value of a given field requires continuation lines (for example, for descriptions longer than one line) make sure you use four spaces when indenting new lines. You will need to customize the field values. Here’s an example of what the customized DESCRIPTION file may look like: Package: cointoss Type: Package Title: Simulates Tossing a Coin Version: 0.1.0 Author: Gaston Sanchez Maintainer: Gaston Sanchez &lt;gaston@email.com&gt; Description: Functions to create a coin object, to toss a coin multiple times, and to summarize and visualize frequencies of the tosses. License: GPL-2 Encoding: UTF-8 LazyData: true 10.3 Mandatory Fields Because you will need to customize some of the fields of your DESCRIPTION file, we need to review some of the most important ones, especially the seven ones that are mandatory: Package Title Description Author Maintainer Version License All other fields are optional. 10.3.1 Package Name Every R package needs a name, specified in the Package field. The package of our study-case is &quot;cointoss&quot; but you can actually use a different name. However, you need to follow three rules to choose a valid package name: the name can only consist of (ASCII) letters, numbers and dot. it must start with a letter. it cannot end with a period. This means that we could have chosen names like COINTOSS, CoinToss, co1nto55, coin.toss, or Cointoss, for example. Unfortunately, this also implies that you can’t use either hyphens - or underscores _ in your package name. For example, you cannot have a name like coin-toss or coin_toss. In case of doubt about choosing a name, I recommed reading Hadley Wickham’s suggestions for naming a package: r-pkgs: package naming. 10.3.2 Title The Title field corresponds to a short description of the package. If the idea of short description sounds too vague, you can think of Title simply as a slogan. Here are the (somewhat restrictive) rules to write a valid title value: it should use title case (that is, use capitals for the principal words). not use any markup. not have any continuation lines. not end in a period. do not repeat the package name if you refer to other packages and external software then that has to be done in single quotes. if you refer to book titles (and similar), then that has to be done in double quotes. 10.3.3 Description The Description field provides a comprehensive description of what your package is designed for. The entire description must be given with one paragraph, which can contain various sentences. The same rules of double quotes used in Title apply to Description. If you use URLs in your description, these should be enclosed in angle brackets, e.g. &lt;https://www.r-project.org&gt;. 10.3.4 Author and Maintainer You need to provide the name(s) of the author(s). You also need to designate one (and only one) person who will be in charge of maintaining the package. The role of the maintainer is essentially fixing bugs, and integrate new code and build a new version. 10.3.5 Version Another mandatory field is Version, which as you may guess, gives the version of the package. The version is a sequence of at least two (and usually three) non-negative integers separated by single . (dot) or - (hyphen) characters. Among the different versioning schemes, perhaps the most common one consists of &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;. For example, consider a version number 1.5.3, 1 is the major number, 5 is the minor number, and 3 is the patch number. Keep in mind that as you keep working on a package, releasing new versions of it, the version number of the package must increase. Another important detail has to do with the fact that version numbers are NOT decimal numbers. For instance, two versions 0.8 and 0.55 does not mean that 0.8 &gt; 0.55. On the contrary, the order is 0.8 &lt; 0.55` because 8 &lt; 55 (again, they are not decimal numbers). 10.3.6 License Your package needs a license. You should choose a license intended for software. Software licenses generally refer to source code. The explicit reference to source code recognizes the fact that software code can exist in its source form, in addition to its binary form. What licenses are available? There is a list of suggested licenses in the R-project website: https://www.r-project.org/Licenses. MIT: MIT license GPL-2 or GPL-3: GNU General Public License (GPL) Artistic-2.0: Artistic License version 2.0 apache-2 Apache License 2.0 BSD_3_clause: BSD 3-Clause “New” or “Revised” license BSD_2_clause: BSD 2-Clause “Simplified” or “FreeBSD” license LGPL-2: GNU Library or “Lesser” General Public License (LGPL) You can find more user friendly information about these and other popular licenses in the website of the Open Source Initiative. Likewise, you can also check the “Choose a license” guidelines available at https://choosealicense.com/licenses/. Although R-project suggests the “Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike International License” version 4.0, I discourage the use of any Creative Commons (CC) license for software. CC licenses are good for media content (e.g. arrative, images, music), but not for source code. To know more about the different fields in a description file, see r-pkgs: Package metadata. 10.4 Optional Fields In addition to the previous seven mandatory fields, DESCRIPTION files can contain other optional fields. Here’s a few of them. 10.4.1 Encoding Ideally, the DESCRIPTION file should be written entirely in ASCII characters. Sometimes, though, you need to use non-ASCII characters like accents, umlauts, cedillas, etc. Using the Encoding: UTF-8 allows you to use unicode characters. For example, had I decided to use my name in its Spanish version, I would specify author as Author: Gastón Sánchez, which has acute accents. 10.4.2 LazyData The LazyData field is a logical field that controls whether the R datasets use lazy-loading. This implies that your package contains data files (&quot;cointoss&quot; does not have any data files). 10.4.3 Type Another optional field is Type, which specifies the type of the package. This field is kind of a historical left-over. In the past, there used to be a Translation type (no longer used). If you don’t include Type, then it is assumed to be Package. 10.4.4 VignetteBuilder If your package includes vignettes (i.e. there’s a vignettes/ subdirectory) written with .Rmd files, then DESCRIPTION needs a field and value VignetteBuilder: knitr.

["namespace.html", "11 Namespace 11.1 Introduction 11.2 About Namespaces 11.3 Namespace of a Package", " 11 Namespace 11.1 Introduction In addition to the mandatory DESCRIPTION file in the top level of the package directory, an R package also requires another mandatory text file called NAMESPACE. This file, with its syntax and its purpose, is perhaps one of the more disorienting elements in a package. So let me try to demistify and explain what a name NAMESPACE file is used for. 11.2 About Namespaces Admittedly, the word namespace is one of those terms that says everything and nothing at the same time. The meaning behind namespace is basically that: space for a name. That’s the simple part. The complication arises when we naturally ask: What name? What space? According to Wikipedia: In computing, a namespace is a set of symbols that are used to organize objects of various kinds, so that these objects may be referred to by name. Prominent examples include: file systems are namespaces that assign names to files some programming languages organize their variables and subroutines in namespaces computer networks and distributed systems assign names to resources, such as computers, printers, websites, (remote) files, etc. The main concept is that of a name of an object and its value. For example, consider the following code in which objects a and b are created: a &lt;- 1 b &lt;- c(&#39;hi&#39;, &#39;there&#39;) From a technical point of view, the command a &lt;- 1 implies that an object named a is being assigned the value of 1. In turn, the command b &lt;- c('hi', 'there') involves creating an object named b which takes the value of a character vector. When you type the name of an object, R will look up for it and see what value is associated to (if the object exists). In order to uniquely and correctly identified the value of a name (i.e. named object), R uses a formal system of environments, scoping rules, and namespaces. Without entering into the details of environments, and scoping rules, the idea of a namespace is to provide a context so that R knows how to find the value of an object associated with a name. The lack of such a context would result in total chaos. Why is this context extremely important with R packages? The best way to answer this question is by thinking about two (or more) different packages containing a function with the same name. For instance, base R contains the function norm() which computes the norm of a matrix (and returns an error when you pass a vector to it). Say that I write my own function norm() to compute the norm of a vector. If I run the command norm(1:5), what’s going to happen? Will R get confused about which norm() to use? Will it use R’s base norm()? Or will it use my norm()? This is where namespaces come very handy. Let’s assume that my function norm() is actually part of a package called &quot;vectortools&quot;. By having a dedicated namespace for each package, we can use the :: operator to tell R which function (which name) to use: either base::norm() or vectortools::norm(). 11.3 Namespace of a Package So far we’ve discussed the idea of a namescape, which is what allows you to invoke commands such as vectortools::norm(), so that R does not get confused about which function norm() to use. But what about the file NAMESPACE? According the technical manual Writing R Extensions, This file contains namespace directives describing the imports and exports of the namespace. What does this mean? In regards to a package, the concept of names has to do with the names of the objects in the package. Most objects in a package are the functions that it is made of. But a package can also contain data sets typically in the form of data frames, or matrices, or other types of data structures. The so-called namespace directives is just the fancy name used to indicate: 1) which functions of your package will be exported, and optionally 2) which functions from other packages are imported by your package, or 3) which packages need to be imported because your package depends on them. 11.3.1 Exported Functions Not all the functions that you write have to be available for the end-user. Often, you will be writing small auxiliary functions that are called by other functions. A typical example of these functions are checkers (or validators). In the &quot;cointoss&quot; package example, we have functions like check_sides() and check_prob(), which are the auxiliary functions called by the constructor function coin(). The constructor is the function that has been designed for the end user; the auxiliary functions are not intended to be called by the end user. You can tell R which functions are to be exported: those that the end user is supposed to invoke. And which functions to keep “under the hood” (by not exporting them, by default). The list of functions and methods that will be exported (export directives) goes inside the NAMESPACE. Likewise, if your package uses functions from other packages that don’t form part of R’s base distribution, you should also specify these in the NAMESPACE file. 11.3.2 Roxygen export This book assumes that you are using roxygen comments to document the functions. The good news is that roxygen has a dedicated keyword that let’s you specify an export directive: the @export keyword. Every time you include an @export comment in the documentation of a function, this will be taken into account when running the code that generates the corresponding documentation (i.e. in an .Rd file). Here’s an example with the code of the coin() function. Notice the roxygen comment @export to indicate that this function must be exported in the namespace of the package. #&#39; @title Coin #&#39; @description Creates an object of class \\code{&quot;coin&quot;} #&#39; @param sides vector of coin sides #&#39; @param prob vector of side probabilities #&#39; @return an object of class \\code{&quot;coin&quot;} #&#39; @export #&#39; @examples #&#39; # default #&#39; coin1 &lt;- coin() #&#39; coin &lt;- function(sides = c(&quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;), prob = c(0.5, 0.5)) { check_sides(sides) check_prob(prob) object &lt;- list( sides = sides, prob = prob) class(object) &lt;- &quot;coin&quot; object } The way we are going to build a package will be done in such a manner that R will automatically generate content for the NAMESPACE file. Assuming that coin() was the only exported function, then NAMESPACE would look like this: # Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand export(coin) This means that the package &quot;roxygen2&quot; is actually doing the work for us, automatically updating NAMESPACE. Observe the syntax export(coin), meaning that coin() will be exported. "],

This requires adding a subdirectory tests/. Inside this directory you have to include an .R script file testthat.R and a subdirectory called testthat/. More specifically: In the directory of the package, create a folder &quot;tests&quot;. Inside the folder tests/ create another folder &quot;testthat&quot;; this is where you include R scripts containing the unit tests. All the script files inside testthat/ should start with tha name test e.g. test-coin.R, test-toss.R, etc. Inside the folder testthat/, create an R script testthat.R Figure 12.1: Structure of test files 12.3 Script testthat.R The script testthat.R is just an auxiliary. The content of this file is very minimalist, with three lines of code, something like this: library(testthat) library(cointoss) test_check(&quot;cointoss&quot;) As you can tell, you simply load the package testthat, then load your package, and finally run test_check() on your package. 12.4 About &quot;testthat&quot; &quot;testthat&quot; is one of the packages in R that helps you write tests for your functions. One of the main references is the paper testthat: Get Started with Testing by Hadley Wickham (see link below). This paper clearly describes the philisoply and workflow of &quot;testthat&quot;. But keep in mind that since the introduction of the package, many more functions haven been added to it. https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-1/RJournal_2011-1_Wickham.pdf &quot;testthat&quot; provides a testing framework for R that is easy to learn and use &quot;testthat&quot; has a hierarchical structure made up of: expectations tests contexts Figure 12.2: Conceptual test structure A context involves tests formed by groups of expectations Figure 12.3: Abstract and functional representations Each structure has associated functions: expect_that() for expectations test_that() for groups of tests context() for contexts Figure 12.4: Description of testthat components 12.4.1 List of common expectation functions Function Description expect_true(x) expects that x is TRUE expect_false(x) expects that x is FALSE expect_null(x) expects that x is NULL expect_type(x) expects that x is of type y expect_is(x, y) expects that x is of class y expect_length(x, y) expects that x is of length y expect_equal(x, y) expects that x is equal to y expect_equivalent(x, y) expects that x is equivalent to y expect_identical(x, y) expects that x is identical to y expect_lt(x, y) expects that x is less than y expect_gt(x, y) expects that x is greater than y expect_lte(x, y) expects that x is less than or equal to y expect_gte(x, y) expects that x is greater than or equal y expect_named(x) expects that x has names y expect_matches(x, y) expects that x matches y (regex) expect_message(x, y) expects that x gives message y expect_warning(x, y) expects that x gives warning y expect_error(x, y) expects that x throws error y 12.4.2 Remarks Each testing file should contain a single context() call that provides a brief description of its contents. You can organize your tests any way that you like. But again, the two extremes are clearly bad (all tests in one file, one file per test). You need to find a happy medium that works for you. A good starting place is to have one file of tests for each complicated function. To know more about testing a package with &quot;testthat&quot;, see r-pkgs: Testing. "],
["vignettes.html", "13 Vignettes 13.1 Introduction 13.2 Including Vignettes", " 13 Vignettes 13.1 Introduction In addition to the manual documentation of the .Rd files, an R package can optionally contain another kind of supporting documentation known as vignettes. A vignette is basically a tutorial, intentionally designed to show users how to utilize the functions in the package. If you’ve never seen a vignette before, or are not sure if you’ve seen one, here’s an example of the introductory vignette in the package &quot;dplyr&quot;: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html 13.2 Including Vignettes If you decide that your package needs one or more vignettes (which I strongly recommend), then you need to add a subdirectory called vignettes/. You can have as many vignettes as you consider convenient. Inside the vignettes/ subdirectory, you add either .Rmd (R markdown) files or .Rnw (R noweb) files. Since the markdown syntax is simpler than latex, I prefer to use .Rmd files to write the content of the vignettes. Figure 13.1: Structure of vignette files When creating an .Rmd file for a vignette, you need to modify the yaml header with the following fields: --- title: &quot;Vignette Title&quot; author: &quot;Vignette Author&quot; date: &quot;` r Sys.Date()`&quot; output: rmarkdown::html_vignette vignette: &gt; %\\VignetteIndexEntry{Vignette Title} %\\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown} \\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} --- Don’t forget to customize the values of the yaml fields: title: the title of the vignette: e.g. “Introduction to Package cointoss” author: who is the author(s) of the vignette date: the default value will insert today’s date (but can choose a differnt date). output: although there are various output formats available for .Rmd files, when used for vignettes you need to specify rmarkdown::html_vignette. This format has been specifically designed to work well inside packages. vignette: this is the last yaml field which contains a special block of metadata needed by R. You only need to modify the \\VignetteIndexEntry to provide the title of your vignette. The other two lines should not be changed. They tell R to use knitr to process the file, and that the file is encoded in UTF-8 (the only encoding you should ever use to write vignettes). The following screenshot shows part of the contents in the introductory vignette for the working example package &quot;cointoss&quot;. Notice that there is a code chunk with the library() function in order to load the package: e.g. library(cointos.

["states.html", "14 Package States 14.1 Introduction 14.2 Package States", " 14 Package States 14.1 Introduction In this chapter we describe the five states of a package, and the functions in &quot;devtools&quot; that allow you to generate such states. I will walk you through these states without diving very deep into more subtle details. To know more about the different states of a package, see r-pkgs: Package structure. 14.2 Package States The creation process of an R package can be done in several ways. Depending on the modus operandi that you choose to follow, it is possible for a package to exist in five different states: Source Bundled Binary Installed In-memory Figure 14.1: Five possible states of a package 14.2.1 Source Package The starting point is always a source package. This is basically the directory (i.e. folder) containing the subdirectories and files that form your package. You can think of this state as a package in a raw stage. From a source package, you can transition to more “mature” (less raw) states. Figure 14.2: Source package 14.2.2 Bundled Package The next immediate state (although not mandatory) is a bundled package. This involves wrapping the source package into a single compressed file with extension .tar.gz. What exactly is this file? A .tar file, also known as “tarball”, is a standard format in the Unix/Linux environment, short for Tape ARchive. A .gz file is simply the type of compression. Therefore, a .tar.gz file is a compressed tarball. Figure 14.3: Bundled package (tarball) To generate a bundled package from a source package, you can use the &quot;devtools&quot; function build(). This will combine of the necessary components in a single file, and gz-compress it for you. When/how do you use a .tar.gz package? In a not so distant past, this was the default option that I would use to share a package, via email, without passing through CRAN. I would took the bundled package of an experimental version and email it to my colleagues so they could install it in their machines. They would simple need to download the .tar.gz file, and then use install.packages() with the filepath of the bundled package. Nowadays you don’t really need bundled packages that much, especially with file-sharing and file-hosting services like GitHub, google drive, dropbox, etc. 14.2.3 Binary Package A package in binary form is another type of state for a package. This is another type of compressed file, but in a platform specific way depending on an operating system (e.g. Mac/Linux, Windows). Figure 14.4: Binary package (platform specific) To give you another description of the idea of a binary package, let me use the excellent metaphor written by David Eaton in the Quora forum. The package that you want to install is like a 3-course meal. The binary package is pretty much the food itself. That’s the thing you want to eat. It’s been specifically prepared for a guest based on her requirements (spiciness, temperature, intolerance to certain ingredients, etc). The binary is the set of instructions that your computer understands how to run in order to make the software work. It’s been specifically tailored for a particular type of computer operating system. 14.2.4 Installed Package An installed package is a decompressed binary file that has been unwrapped into an actual package library. Figure 14.5: Installed package (decompressed binary) Keeping with the metaphor of the 3-course meal, an installed package is associated with an installer. An installer is like the waiter, getting your food and preparing everything for you to eat it: plates, glasses, cutlery, napkins, portions of fodd, etc. The installer basically gets your food ready for you to eat it. An installer does prep-work on your computer. While the binary may have all the instructions it needs, the installer may need to perform some set-up tasks. To install a package with &quot;devtools&quot;, you use the install() function. You can use this function to take a package in the form of source, bundled, or binary, to install it in your computer. 14.2.5 In-memory Package Lastly, in order to use an installed package you need to load it into memory. This is done with the library() function. Figure 14.6: In-memory package (loaded to be used) 14.2.6 Remarks During the development of a package, you always start at the source level, and eventually make your way to an installed version. In theory, the building process would consist of the following flow: source -&gt; bundle -&gt; binary -&gt; installed —&gt; in-memory. In practice, however, you can take some detours and shortcuts from source to installed. Figure 14.7: Theoretical flow of package states "],
["flow.html", "15 Packaging Flow 15.1 Introduction 15.2 Example Structure 15.3 Worklfow", " 15 Packaging Flow 15.1 Introduction For better or for worse, there is not a unique recipe to build a package. In other words, there is not a unique sequence of steps that you should always follow in order to take a source package and make it part of the installed packages. In this chapter I will describe an opinionated workflow to pack the source code of our working example. 15.2 Example Structure The following diagram depicts the filestructure for our working example with the package cointoss. Figure 15.1: Assumed filestructure Let’s assume that the source package you are developing has the previous structure. If this is not the case for you, at least keep in mind that the mandatory components are DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE, R/ and man/. 15.3 Worklfow Because a package is made up of various types of files—which can be located in different subdirectories—that play different roles, you can actually break down the overall creation of a package into separate pieces. Interestingly, each of the resulting pieces can be created separately. Consequently, the packaging process that you follow may depend on the piece (or pieces) that need to be built as you add or change components in a package. The core part of a package is the code in the R/ directory. Most of the modifications made at this level will very likely have a cascading effect on the rest of elements in the package. From this point of view, a typical packaging workflow involves the following steps: Create Documentation Check Documentation Run Tests Knit Vignettes Build Bundle Install Package Check Package You can use functions from &quot;devtools&quot; to individually perform each of the actions previously listed. The following table shows such functions: Action Function Create Documentation devtools::document() Check Documentation devtools::check_man() Run Tests devtools::test() Knit Vignettes devtools::build_vignettes() Build Bundle devtools::build() Install binary devtools::install() Check devtools::check() Create Documentation: When you change the roxygen comments of your functions, you will need to (re)generate the corresponding manual documentation. This can be done with the function devtools::document() which generates the so-called .Rd (R documentation) files, located in the man/ directory. Check Documentation: An optional, but strongly recommended, step after new documentation has been generated, is to check that it is correct. This step becomes mandatory if you plan to share your package via CRAN. To check that the .Rd files are okay, use the function devtools::check_man(). This function inspects that the content and syntax of the .Rd files are correct. A typical cause for this check-up to fail is when you have typos or inconsistencies. For example: when the definition of a function contains the argument x but your roxygen comment @param uses y. Run Tests: If your package contains unit-tests, included in the directory tests/, you can use the function devtools::test() to run such tests. Build Vignettes: If your package contains vignettes, included in the directory vignettes/, you can use the function devtools::build_vignettes() to build them. This function generates the vignettes by knitting the .Rmd files in the vignettes/ directory, and it will produce output files in the inst/ folder. Build Bundle: If you just simply want to convert a package source into a single bundled file, you use the function devtools::build(). This function will create, by default, the .tar.gz file that in turn can be installed on any platform. To create a binary package, you have to use the argument binary = TRUE. Keep in mind that this generated binary will be platform specific, and will only be installable on the current platform. Most of the time, there is no need to create a binary package. build() does not generate or check any documentation. It also does not run any tests. However, build() does build vignettes by default. Install: To install the package you can use devtools::install(). This function can install a source, bundle or a binary package. After the installation is done, you should be able to load the package with library() in order to use its functions, inspect its manual documentation, and read the available vignettes. Check: Optionally, you can carry out an integral check of the package. This checking is a comprehensive one, and it will verify pretty much every single detail. 15.3.1 Optional devtools file Unless you are constantly creating packages, you will very likely forget what functions to use for a specific purpose. One small hack that I tend to use is to include an auxiliary .R file in the source package, which I typically name as devtools-flow.R (or something like that). This file basically contains the list of &quot;devtools&quot; functions that we’ve discussed so far. The following code shows the typical commands of the auxiliary file: # ===================================================== # Devtools workflow # ===================================================== devtools::document() # generate documentation devtools::check_man() # check documentation devtools::test() # run tests devtools::build_vignettes() # build vignettes devtools::build() # build bundle devtools::install() # install package You can think of this auxiliary file, e.g. devtools-flow.R, as a cheat-sheet. But keep in mind that this is an additional file that the building functions are NOT expecting to find. That’s why you should include the name of this file in your .Rbuildignore file. Add a new line with the name of the file to .Rbuildignore, and remember to anchor it with the caret ^ character. Here’s what your .Rbuildignore file may look like: ^.*\\.Rproj$ ^\\.Rproj\\.user$ ^devtools-flow.R I should also say that the inclusion of a devtools-flow.R file is completely optional, and there are actually more efficient (but also more advanced/complex) ways to add a master script that you execute in a programmatic way everytime something new has to be built. 15.3.2 Sample Package cointoss You can find the source package of &quot;cointoss&quot; in the following github repository: https://github.com/gastonstat/cointoss Feel free to download (or clone) the repository and modify its contents to experiment and practice how to create an R package. Happy packaging and … May the FoRce be with You! "],
["sharing.html", "16 Sharing 16.1 Introduction 16.2 File sharing 16.3 GitHub", " 16 Sharing 16.1 Introduction Once you’ve created a package, you may be interested in sharing it with your friends, colleagues, collaborators, boss, and maybe any useR in the world. In this chapter I will describe a couple of ways to share your package. 16.2 File sharing The most straighforward way to share your package is to take the bundled package (.tar.gz file) and share it with whoever you want. Perhaps the simplest way to do this is to email the bundle file, or share it through a file-sharing service like Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, etc. To install your package, the users will have to download it to their computers, and then install it with the function install.packages(), specifying the path of the .tar.gz file. Or they can also use the menu options from RStudio’s Packages tab (see screenshot below). Figure 16.1: Installing a .tar.gz file from RStudio’s Packages tab Go to the Packages tab Click on the Install button Select the option Install from: Select Package Archive File (.tar.gz) Specify the location of the .tar.gz file and finally click Install. 16.3 GitHub Another very convenient way to share your package is GitHub. I’m assuming that you have a GitHub account, and that you have some familiary with this service. If you use GitHub to host your package source, the &quot;devtools&quot; function install_github() is the way to go. All you (or any other user) have to do is specify the GitHub username, and the name of the repository containing the source code: devtools::install_github(&quot;usrname/pkgname&quot;) You can try installing my &quot;cointoss&quot; package with install_github() like this: devtools::install_github(&quot;gastonstat/cointoss&quot;) this is equivalent to: devtools::install_github(&quot;cointoss&quot;, username = &quot;gastonstat&quot;) If a package is in some subdirectory inside a github repository, you can also use install_github(). Pretend that the source package is in the folder &quot;cointoss&quot;, inside my github repository repo. A user sould be able to install the package running the following command: devtools::install_github(&quot;repo&quot;, username = &quot;gastonstat&quot;, subdir = &quot;cointoss&quot;) A few things to keep in mind about install_github(): devtools::install_github() allows you to install a remote package. it downloads a source package, builds it and then installs it. by default, it does not build vignettes (to save time). to build vignettes use devtools::install_github(build_vignettes = TRUE).
