# Sharing {#sharing}

## Introduction

Once you've created a package, you may be interested in sharing it with your friends, colleagues, collaborators, boss, and maybe any useR in the world. In this chapter I will describe a couple of ways to share your package.


## File sharing

The most straighforward way to share your package is to take the bundled package (`.tar.gz` file) and share it with whoever you want. Perhaps the simplest way to do this is to email the bundle file, or share it through a file-sharing service like Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, etc.

To install your package, the users will have to download it to their computers, and then install it with the function `install.packages()`, specifying the path of the `.tar.gz` file. Or they can also use the menu options from RStudio's Packages tab (see screenshot below).

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Installing a .tar.gz file from RStudio's Packages tab"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/share-install.png")
```

- Go to the __Packages__ tab
- Click on the __Install__ button
- Select the option __Install from:__
- Select __Package Archive File (.tar.gz)__
- Specify the location of the `.tar.gz` file
- and finally click __Install__.


## GitHub

Another very convenient way to share your package is GitHub. I'm assuming that you have a GitHub account, and that you have some familiary with this service. If you use GitHub to host your package source, the `"devtools"` function `install_github()` is the way to go.

All you (or any other user) have to do is specify the GitHub username, and the name of the repository containing the source code:

```
devtools::install_github("usrname/pkgname")
```

You can try installing my `"cointoss"` package with `install_github()` like this:

```
devtools::install_github("gastonstat/cointoss")
```

this is equivalent to:

```
devtools::install_github("cointoss", username = "gastonstat")
```

If a package is in some subdirectory inside a github repository, you can also use `install_github()`. Pretend that the source package is in the folder `"cointoss"`, inside my github repository `repo`. A user sould be able to install the package running the following command:

```
devtools::install_github("repo", username = "gastonstat", subdir = "cointoss")
```

A few things to keep in mind about `install_github()`:

- `devtools::install_github()` allows you to install a remote package.
- it downloads a source package, builds it and then installs it.
- by default, it does not build vignettes (to save time).
- to build vignettes use `devtools::install_github(build_vignettes = TRUE)`.
