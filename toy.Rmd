# (PART) Package Structure {-}

# Toy Package

## Introduction

In this chapter you will learn how to quickly build an _off-the-shelf_ R package (in less than a minute) following the default options provided by RStudio. I prefer to show you this option first, before describing how to create a package with the functions of our `"coin"` and `"toss"` objects. 


## An off-the-shelf package

Nowadays you can create an R package in an almost instant way. Here's the list of steps to follow in RStudio that allows you to create the structure of a package from scratch.

1. On the menu bar, click __File__ and select __New Project__

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Starting point for a new project'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pkg-step0-new.png")
```

2. Then choose __New Directory__

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Different types of RStudio projects'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pkg-step1-project.png")
```

3. Choose __R package__

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pkg-step2-type.png")
```

4. Give it a name: e.g. "cointoss"

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Choosing a name for a package'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pkg-step4-name.png")
```

5. The filestructure of your package will be created with some default content. Here's a screenshot of how the panes in RStudio look like in my computer. Notice the default R script `hello.R` and the file structure in the __Files__ tab:

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pkg-step5-panes.png")
```


## Minimal Filestructure

If you look at pane with the __Files__ tab, you should be able to see the following files and directories:

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Minimal filestructure created by devtools'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pkg-step6-files.png")
```

We've ended up with six components inside the package folder. Here's the description of each file:

- `DESCRIPTION` is a text file (with no extension) that has metadata for your package. Simply put, this file is like the business card of your package.

- `NAMESPACE` is a text file (also with no extension) that is used to list the functions that will be available to be called by the user.

- The `R/` directory which is where you store all the R script files with the functions of the package.

- The `man/` directory which is the folder containing the `Rd` (R documentation) files, that is, the text files with the technical _help_ documentation of the functions in your package.

- `cointoss.Rproj` is an RStudio project file that is designed to make your package easy to use with RStudio.

- `.Rbuildignore` is a _hidden_ text file used to specify files to be ignored by R when building the _tar-ball_ or _bundle_ of the package.


## Quick Build

With the _hello world_ content automatically created by `devtools`, you can quickly build a tiny package. In this case, there's only one function, the `hello()` function, that simply prints a hi message.

If you inspect the content of the file `hello.R` (inside the `R/` directory), you will see some comments suggesting a list of steps and their keyboard shortcuts:

- Build and Reload Package: `Cmd + Shift + B`
- Check Package: `Cmd + Shift + E`
- Test Package: `Cmd + Shift + T`

Alternatively, if you go to the __Build__ tab, you will find the _Install and Restart_ button, the _Check_ button, and the _More_ menu with additional building options.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Options in the Build tab'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pkg-step6-build.png")
```

I recommend that you follow the suggested steps to see what happens: build the package and check it:

- Build and Reload Package: `Cmd + Shift + B`
- Check Package: `Cmd + Shift + E`

If everything went fine, you should have been able to create a toy _hello world_ R package (with one function) that you can load with `library()`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(hello)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
hello <- function() {
  print("Hello, world!")
}
```

and check that it works:

```{r}
hello()
```
