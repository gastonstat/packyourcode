# Vignettes {#vignettes}

## Introduction

In addition to the manual documentation of the `.Rd` files, an R package can optionally contain another kind of supporting documentation known as __vignettes__. A vignette is basically a tutorial, intentionally designed to show users how to utilize the functions in the package. If you've never seen a vignette before, or are not sure if you've seen one, here's an example of the introductory vignette in the package `"dplyr"`:

## Including Vignettes

If you decide that your package needs one or more vignettes (which I strongly recommend), then you need to add a subdirectory called `vignettes/`. You can have as many vignettes as you consider convenient. Inside the `vignettes/` subdirectory, you add either `.Rmd` (R markdown) files or `.Rnw` (R noweb) files. Since the markdown syntax is simpler than latex, I prefer to use `.Rmd` files to write the content of the vignettes.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Structure of vignette files', out.width = "35%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/vignette-files.png")
```

When creating an `.Rmd` file for a vignette, you need to modify the _yaml_ header with the following fields:

```
---
title: "Vignette Title"
author: "Vignette Author"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output: rmarkdown::html_vignette
vignette: >
  %\VignetteIndexEntry{Vignette Title}
  %\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}
  \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
---
```

Don't forget to customize the values of the yaml fields:

- `title`: the title of the vignette: e.g. "Introduction to Package cointoss"

- `author`: who is the author(s) of the vignette

- `date`: the default value will insert today's date (but can choose a differnt date). 

- `output`: although there are various output formats available for `.Rmd` files, when used for vignettes you need to specify `rmarkdown::html_vignette`. This format has been specifically designed to work well inside packages.

- `vignette`: this is the last yaml field which contains a special block of metadata needed by R. You only need to modify the `\VignetteIndexEntry` to provide the title of your vignette. The other two lines should not be changed. They tell R to use knitr to process the file, and that the file is encoded in UTF-8 (the only encoding you should ever use to write vignettes).

The following screenshot shows part of the contents in the introductory vignette for the working example package `"cointoss"`. Notice that there is a code chunk with the `library()` function in order to load the package: e.g. `library(cointos`.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Screenshot of the vignette in cointoss', out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/vignette-rmd.png")
```
